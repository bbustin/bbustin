I have primarily been a backend developer with a little bit of web frontend experience using Vue.js.\nAre We GUI Yet lists the various Rust GUI frameworks. The description for Dioxus sounded intriguing.Hopefully this is not drinking the Kool-Aid. See Google Web Toolkit, an attempt to allow writing frontend code in Java which would then be transpiled into Javascript. I had to work with a legacy app using that for its frontend and it was a disaster. THe current version might be better. We were using an old version that had gone out of support over 10 years ago. Fun times...\nI am going to be reading through the Dioxus Getting Started Guide and learning as I write this. This is not a tutorial. It is my journey learning Dioxus and attempting a GUI application.\nGetting the tooling all set up\n\nRust ✅ - already installed\nDioxus CLI ✅ - had to get the OpenSSL dependency set up as documented in the link in the getting started docs\n\nBuilding the HotDog application\nEach of the headers in this section link to the corresponding page in the Dioxus documentation.\nSetting Up Tooling\nThe getting started documentation is going to have us build Tinder for Dogs. It says the wasm32-unknown-unknown toolchain must be installed. I do not think I have that installed. Toolchain is not the right word, it technically is a compilation target.\nI sent a pull request to the project to fix this tiny issue and it was quickly accepted.\n\nTurns out I already have it installed.\nCreating a new app\nI run dx new hot_dog as instructed and choose the options specified in the documentation. The tooling is very slick.\n\nI really like how it documents the next steps. This makes using it more approachable. Even if you aren't following the getting started and making Dog Tinder.\nThen I run dx serve as instructed, open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in my browser, and there is a Dioxus website. Very nice so far. I am curious what code leveraging the library is going to be like.\nThe getting started documentation is well done. It is going over the project structure and explaining everything with just the right level of detail. Hats off to the Dioxus team. Nicely done.\nI clear away all of the boilerplate, as instructed. The webpage in my browser hot reloads and it says HotDog! which is exactly what I am thinking as this is going so smoothly.\nFirst Component\n\nIn Dioxus, apps are comprised of individual functions called Components that take in some Properties and render an Element\n\nMakes sense to me.\nThe starting point for src/main.rs is:\n\nNo I add a component called DogApp which accepts a breed parameter and then I use it in the `App function.\n\nThe webpage displays Breed: Brittany Spaniel. I have created a component. The framework does some cool work behind the scenes to make this work. The documents describe that a Struct called DogAppProps (name of the component with Props at the end). If you are building an API, the docs recommend creating those structs manually.\nCreating UI with RSX\n\n..all quoted strings in RSX imply format!() automatically, so you can define a variable outside your markup and use it in your strings without an explicit\n\nI like that. It makes things a little less verbose.\nOne thing I do not like is that if the build fails, the hot reloading sometimes stops even though dx serve is still running. To get around this, I need to press ctrl + c and then run it again. Not a big deal, just a minor annoyance.\nNow the code looks like this:\n\nStyling and Assets\nStyling in Dioxus uses CSS. So you essentially do this...\n\nI make the changes above (but leave in all of the other code). Then I copy in the stylesheet from the tutorial into /assets/main.css. It looks nice and the hot reloading just works. Pretty sweet!\nAdding State\nNow we:\n\nSplit the Title and DogView out of App since DogView is going to have associated state and title will not.\nAdd event handlers to DogView.\nMake the image source part of the DogView state and define a starting image with the use_signal function. (Note to future self: Read the State Management Guide)\n\n\nFetching Data\nDog Tinder needs to be able to get other dogs for when you skip. This app is going to use the dog.ceo/dog-api to get images. So we need a library to call the API, and also a library to deserialize the response.\n\nIt looks like Dioxus can fetch the image on its own. The tricky part is calling the dog.ceo API and getting the URL for the image to display.\nThe code looks like this now:\n\nAdding a Backend\nIt looks like the dx command does these steps for you automatically if you choose full stack when creating your project.\nEdit the cargo.toml file and:\n\nadd the fullstack feature to the dioxus dependency\nremove the default = [\"web\"] feature\nadd the server = [\"dioxus/server\"] feature\n\nMy cargo.toml now looks like this.\n\nThen ctrl+c dx serve and instead run dx serve --platform web since it no longer has a default.\nThen we create a server endpoint to save the dog which takes an image parameter. It just saves it to a text file. Then the client code needs to call the server function. I just followed the steps.\nThe documentation does mention that you need to be careful making sure any server-side secrets are not exposed to the client. In that case, you can put the server code in a different module behind #[cfg(feature = \"server\")]. Hopefully they will get more into that later on. The code below does not have any secrets and does not split the code. Everything is also in main.rs. In a real project, some more structure would help keep things neat.\nThe other thing I would want to improve over the tutorial code are all the unwraps. It might be good to have more explicit error handling. This is just a tutorial app though. 😁\nIt works though!\nHere is how the code looks...\n\nWorking with Databases\nWe are going to get the app working with a SQLite database.\nI chose to use the cargo command to add the dependency to the server feature rather than editing cargo.toml by hand. This may come to bite me as the resulting cargo.toml is different from the example. (Spoiler: It does... do not run this command or you'll have to manually clean up your cargo.toml.)\n\nThen I add the database connection code as per the tutorial.\nThe way I chose to add the rusqlite dependency did come to bite me. IT turns out I had confused a target with a feature. I undid the changes in my cargo.toml and made it reflect the how it is in the tutorial, but I used the latest version.\nI use DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) to verify the dog image urls are actually getting saved, and they are.\nHere is the current code:\n\nRouting and Structure\nNice! Now the tutorial is going over better structuring the code. It is going to look like this:\n\nI'm essentially creating all these files. Then moving the server-specific code to backend.rs. Then the UI components that are still in main.rs will get moved into the proper files in src/components/.\nThe documentation notes that, if this project were started with the Jumpstart or Workplace template, then a lot of this scaffolding would already exist.\nI'm a little confused at this point because the code in my main.rs is not working. I can't access the App component in views.rs. The documentation is moving on to adding a router, so I am probably getting ahead of myself.\nI need to add the dioxus router feature.\n\nThen I follow the document to make a Route enum and an app function that leverages the router. The documentation is getting a lot harder to follow at this point. For example, I add the default route for when a page is not found, but PageNotFound is not found in the scope. Does that mean I need to create my own, or is this something I need ot add with a use statement somewhere?\nI keep pressing on. Lots of times I get ahead of myself. Perhaps all will be answered soon. The next screenshot does not have PageNotFound. It is also leveraging DogView from components, unlike the earlier code it showed with\n\nI also had to go into src/backend.rs and make save_dog public. Then I had to go into src/components/view.rs and make DogView public. I also needed to add use crate::backend; and then call the function as backend::save_dog(current).await. I am not sure at this point if all of that is the correct thing to do, but the application is working again. I even verify the dog image urls are still being written properly to the database. Huzzah!\nNow it is time to add a NavBar. This is pretty straight-forward. I just follow the documentation.\nThen I add backend code to get the last 10 saved dogs, and the view code in favorites.rs that uses it. It is pretty slick how this all ties together so nicely. There must be a major downside somewhere...\nThe tutorial is almost over.\nHere is what the code looks like now.\ncargo.toml\n\ndioxus.toml\n\nsrc/main.rs\n\nsrc/backend.rs\n\nsrc/components/favorites.rs\n\nsrc/components/nav.rs\n\nsrc/components/view.rs\n\nsrc/components/mod.rs\n\nBundling\nI might do this later, but I am not sure yet. It allows building an iOS or Android application and testing them.\nConclusion\nDioxus is a pretty neat framework. I am not enough of a fullstack developer to recommend it or not. It seems like the mixing of server and frontend could get you into trouble. On the other hand, it is awfully convenient.\nRust is great for developing efficient runtimes. If Dioxus can be used to create an application with minimal hosting costs, while making it easier to get everything going, that sounds great and I am all for it.\nLong ago, for work, I rewrote one of our small web APIs in Rust. This was for a lunch and learn talk I gave. The original Java version took several seconds to spin up and was guzzling down over 200MB of RAM. My functionally-identical version in Rust spun up in milliseconds and consumed around 4MB of RAM. If the service were used at scale, switching to Rust could have saved a significant amount of money. The talk went over so well, that I gave it again for my colleagues in India. Unfortunately, nothing ever came of it and we stuck to Java.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/creating-a-gui-application-in-rust-using-dioxus/","title":"Creating an Application in Rust using Dioxus"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/creating-horse-hot-or-not/":{"body":"I already followed the Dioxus tutorial and created a GUI application. Now I needed a pet project to learn even more about Dioxus. It couldn't be too complex as I am still learning the framework. It had to have some similarity to the application from the tutorial so I would not get too stuck and could reference it. I did not want to touch user authentication just yet.\nMy idea is Horse Hot or Not. It is a bit of a spoof on an old website that, misogynistically, was used to rate women as being \"Hot\" or \"Not\". Making this site is not an endorsement of the original site. The subject here will be horses.\n\nHere is what the site should do, at a minimum:\n\nRating page\n\nShow a picture of a random horse and \"Hot\" and \"Not\" buttons\nAllow user to click one of the buttons to vote on the horse shown\n\n\nLeaderboard page\n\nShow images of horses starting with the horse that has the highest net number of hot votes (hot - not)\n\n\nKeep a person from being able to rate the same horse multiple times\nNot store user-identifiable data (I am a big fan of privacy and do not want to have more information than is needed)\n\nThe last two items are the ones I spent the most time thinking about before I started coding. The system to prevent multiple votes on a horse does not need to work perfectly. This is not a high stakes site. How could I prevent the user from voting twice while not storing any identifiable information about them?\nThen the idea strikes. I can use a hash. If I store the hash, I can not directly access the identifying information. It would take brute forcing or a rainbow table. That is probably good enough, but what data should I hash? How about user_ip:horse_id. This would allow me to determine if the user voted for a particular horse before because I will have their IP address in the request and will know the id of the horse they are submitting a rating for. I can look up if the hash exists in a database table first, if not, record the vote and then add the hash to a table.\nUsing the IP address as the user identifier is far from perfect. Here are just some of the problems with this approach:\n\nIf the site is accessed from a phone while on WiFi, then the user leaves the location and is on a cellular data connection, their IP address will change\nIPv4 connections behind a NAT router will all come from the same IP address, even if there are multiple people or devices trying to vote. This essentially locks the household down to only being able to vote once for a horse.\nIP addresses do not correspond to individuals, but more to devices.\n\nI could combine this with a browser cookie, and I am sure there are other approaches I could take, but this is good enough for now.\nI get the project all set up and start coding.\nChallenges\nGetting to the Axum configuration\nDioxus uses Axum under the hood, but it does a great job of hiding it. This is a smart approach because there is no need to shoulder the cognitive load of Axum in most cases. Axum does not include much information about the request within it unless configured to do so. I need the IP address the request is being made from.\nI also need to be able to serve static images, but I can not seem to find a way to do that directly from within Dioxus. There is a way to include assets, but that bundles them. I want this to be all self-contained without the need for a CDN or different server setup.\nThe tutorial shows how to get to the Axum configuration. The problem I keep running up against is on this line:\n\nserve_dioxus_application simply does not exist. I eventually find issue 3479. When I added axum to my cargo.toml, I had used a version that was newer than the one supported by Dioxus. Once I change it to version 0.7.9, it starts working. This took me a while to figure it out, but will no longer be a problem soon.\nTo get the connection information in the request, I add let router = router.into_make_service_with_connect_info::&lt;SocketAddr&gt;();.\nTo serve the static images, I use the tower_http ServeDir service and add it to the Axum router. .nest_service(\"/static/horses\", ServeDir::new(\"public/static/horses\"));.\nThe main function in main.rs now looks like this:\n\nLimitations tracking rating submissions\nThe initial idea of using the hashes to represent an individual rating submission for a certain horse is sound. The problem is that it does not allow for getting at some information that could be useful. I decide to hash the IP address, but then have a column for the horse_id, and when the rating was submitted. This does make revealing the user's IP address easier (at least in the case of IPv4) because you could simply create a rainbow table with hashes of all possible IP addresses, and then cross-reference each hash in the database against the rainbow table to reveal the address. That is definitely a downside.\nThe upside is that it allows for more streamlined database queries. The main issue that convinced me to change course was picking a random horse for a user to rate. It does not make sense to serve the user a horse they have already rated. In that scenario, the user would click a rating button, but the rating would not be successfully submitted.\nSure, I could:\n\nGet a random horse\nHash the user's IP with the horse_id\nLook up the hash to see if the user rated this horse\nIf they did rate this horse, repeat the previous steps until a horse they have not rated is found\n\nThis approach has some obvious disadvantages. The most important one to me is it gets more and more compute-intensive the more horses a user has rated. Imagine there are 6,000 horses and the user has rated 5,999 of them. It is going to need to keep repeating the steps until it finds the 1 horse they have not rated. It is not just compute-intensive, it will also get really sluggish.\nWith the horse_id decoupled from the hash, I can simply use a query that returns a random horse where the user's hash and the horse_id in question does not exist in the table where per-user rating submissions are recorded. This will not be compute-intensive and performance will be great.\nIPv6\nI noticed that I could vote for the same horse if I used my computer and then my phone while both were connected to my home's network. My home network uses IPv4 and IPv6. With IPv6 there is no need to be behind NAT. This means each device has a different public IPv6 address. What I needed to do was to actually hash the /64 network address of the IPv6 address. This, in effect, makes it behave closely to the IPv4 behind NAT scenario. It is not perfect. ISPs could assign a /63 or larger network, but it should cover most home networks.\nUI and css\nI am not a UI expert. Getting the UI to be good enough took some work. CSS is great, but there are lots of complexities. This is an area I could use some improvement in.\nThere are still rough edges on the site. I noticed, for example, on a small mobile screen some text that should be centered is not. I have not tried to fix that yet.\nConclusion\nMy second go-round with Dioxus went well. I do like the framework. When researching some of the problems I was having, I saw an active community around the project.\nThe UI state reactivity reminded me of some of the UI work I did in Vue.js for work. Many of the ideas felt, at least superficially, very similar even if the code looks nothing alike.\nDon't forget to check out Horse Hot or Not! 🐎\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/creating-horse-hot-or-not/","title":"🐴 Creating Horse Hot or Not 🐎"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-1/":{"body":"One of my friends on LinkedIn recommended I sign up for the\nDaily Coding Problem email. This is\nProblem #1. I did the work in a Jupyter notebook and then exported it to include here.\n\nNote: The color output of the grader method does work, but it did not export properly.\n\nThe problem\n(Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1 [Easy])\nThis problem was recently asked by Google.\nGiven a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.\nFor example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.\nBonus: Can you do this in one pass?\nMy thoughts\n\nAddition is commutative, so we only need to try each combination once\nShould be able to easily do this in one pass by taking first number and adding it to each other number. Then slide forward and do the same. In this way we should not repeat any combinations.\nIt looks like the ask is only to see if any two numbers add up to k, so there is no need to keep track of the combinations and we can exit out if any combinations are found.\n\nPossible edge cases\n\nNegative numbers, but this should still work fine as -1 and 10, or 10 and -1 should be the same. Let's test, but addition is commutative, so I'm pretty sure.\n\n\n\ncommon setup code - test cases and grading code\n\n\n\nI know this does not satisfy the one pass criteria as there are two loops. I queried qwen2.5-coder for assistance...\n\n\n\nYour provided solution is a valid approach to solving the problem, but it can be improved in terms of time\ncomplexity. Let's analyze your solution and then discuss more efficient alternatives.\nAnalysis of Your Solution\nCode:\n\nTime Complexity:\n\nThe outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the list.\nFor each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs on average n/2 times (since it starts from\nleft_index + 1).\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n^2)).\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity is (O(1)) because you are not using any additional data structures that grow with\ninput size.\n\nMore Efficient Solution\nTo solve this problem in one pass (i.e., (O(n)) time complexity), you can use a set to keep track of the\nnumbers you have seen so far. This allows you to check if the complement of the current number (i.e., k - current_number) has already been encountered.\nCode:\n\nTime Complexity:\n\nThe loop runs n times, where n is the length of the list.\nEach operation (checking membership and adding to a set) on average takes (O(1)) time.\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n)).\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity is (O(n)) because in the worst case, you might store all n numbers in the set.\n\nExplanation of the Efficient Solution\n\nInitialization: Start with an empty set seen_numbers.\nIteration: Loop through each number in the list.\nComplement Check: For each number, calculate its complement (k - number). If this complement is\nalready in seen_numbers, return True because you have found two numbers that add up to k.\nAdd to Set: If the complement is not found, add the current number to seen_numbers.\nCompletion: If the loop completes without finding any such pair, return False.\n\nConclusion\n\nYour original solution has a time complexity of (O(n^2)), which is less efficient for large lists.\nThe more efficient solution using a set has a time complexity of (O(n)) and a space complexity of\n(O(n)), making it suitable for larger inputs.\n\nThe efficient solution meets the bonus requirement of solving the problem in one pass.\nLet's try the AI answer and get a better understanding of it...\n\n\nI asked the AI for more guidance as my math skills are not the greatest...\n\nWhat is a complement as it pertains to mathematics?\n\nIn mathematics, the term \"complement\" can have different meanings depending on the context. However, in the\nspecific context of the problem you're working on—checking if any two numbers from a list add up to a given\nnumber ( k )—the concept of a complement is used to identify the number that, when added to the current\nnumber, equals ( k ).\nComplement in This Context\nGiven a number ( \\text{number} ) and a target sum ( k ), the complement of ( \\text{number} ) with\nrespect to ( k ) is:\n[ \\text{complement} = k - \\text{number} ]\nThis complement is the value that, when added to ( \\text{number} ), results in ( k ).\nExample\nConsider the list [10, 15, 3, 7] and the target sum ( k = 17 ):\n\nFor number = 10, the complement is ( 17 - 10 = 7 ).\nFor number = 15, the complement is ( 17 - 15 = 2 ).\nFor number = 3, the complement is ( 17 - 3 = 14 ).\nFor number = 7, the complement is ( 17 - 7 = 10 ).\n\nIn this example, when you check the number 10, its complement is 7. Since 7 is present in the list,\nthe function should return True.\nEfficient Solution Using Complements\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the efficient solution works using complements:\n\nInitialization: Start with an empty set seen_numbers.\nIteration: Loop through each number in the list.\nComplement Check: For each number, calculate its complement (k - number). If this complement is\nalready in seen_numbers, return True because you have found two numbers that add up to ( k ).\nAdd to Set: If the complement is not found, add the current number to seen_numbers.\nCompletion: If the loop completes without finding any such pair, return False.\n\nCode Example\n\nSummary\n\nComplement: In this context, the complement of a number with respect to ( k ) is the value that,\nwhen added to the number, equals ( k ).\nEfficient Solution: By using a set to track numbers you've seen so far and checking if the complement\nof the current number exists in the set, you can solve the problem in one pass with a time complexity of (\nO(n) ).\n\nThis approach leverages the properties of sets for fast membership testing, making it much more efficient\nthan the nested loop method.\nMore test cases\nThis now makes sense to me. :-)\nI asked the AI to create some more test cases so I can retest, maybe see some of the performance difference,\nas well as validate against addiitonal edge cases it identified.\nFrom the AI:\nExplanation of Test Cases\n\n\nBasic Tests:\n\nSimple cases with positive and negative numbers.\nEdge cases with zero and single-element lists.\n\n\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nLists with no elements ([]).\nLists with a single element ([0], [5]).\n\n\n\nDuplicates:\n\nLists with duplicate numbers that can sum to k ([5, 5], [10, 10]).\n\n\n\nFloating Point Numbers:\n\nLists with floating-point numbers to ensure the function handles them correctly.\n\n\n\nNegative Numbers:\n\nLists with negative numbers to test the function's ability to handle negative complements and sums.\n\n\n\nVarious Sums:\n\nMultiple test cases with different target sums (k) to ensure the function works for various\nscenarios.\n\n\n\nThese test cases should cover a wide range of possible inputs and edge cases, ensuring that the function is\nrobust and handles different types of input effectively.\n\n\n\nfirst_try shows some failed test cases\n\nTest Case: k=5, numbers=[5, 5], correct_answer=True returned False - FAILED\nTest Case: k=9, numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], correct_answer=False returned True - FAILED\n\nSince these test cases came from AI, and AI is not typically great at math yet, I need to dobule-check the test cases.\n\nTest Case: k=5, numbers=[5, 5], correct_answer=True returned False - FAILED\n\nI think this one should really be False. The problem says add two numbers.\n\nTest Case: k=9, numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], correct_answer=False returned True - FAILED\n\n4 + 5 = 9\nI need to fix those two test cases.\n\ngrade first_try again\n\n\ngrade more_efficient\n\n\nNow, let's show the real performance difference between them!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge diffence\nWith 100 million records, the more efficient code finishes nearly 6 seconds faster. Not bad.\nI need to remember the concept of using the complements for this.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-1/","title":"Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-2/":{"body":"This is\nDaily Coding Problem #2. I did the work in a Jupyter\nnotebook and then exported it to include here.\n\nNote: The color output of the grader method does work, but it did not export properly.\n\nDaily Coding Problem\nProblem #2 (Hard)\n\nThis problem was asked by Uber.\n\n\nGiven an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.\n\n\nFor example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].\n\n\nFollow-up: what if you can't use division?\n\nMy Thoughts\nWe're back to math, not my strong suit. If I remember correctly, product is the result of multiplying two numbers.\nTo make sure I am understanding the problem correctly, let me manually work through the problem.\n\n\nMy initial understanding of the problem is not correct. It is not just advancing down the line. Otherwise the result would always have two less than the input.\nHaving that 1 at the beginning also threw me off a little because the second number in my result was\ncorrect. If you look at the third number, it needed to be multiplied by 2 as well.\nSo, basically, we are just excluding the one number we are on.\nThe follow-up question mentions trying to do it without division. Had I not had that clue, I would not have realized I could just multiply all numbers and then divide by the number I am currently on.\nWait a sec, let me validate that assumption...\n\n\nThat does work, for this example...\nI think it might fail in certain scenarios. What if one value was a 0?\n\n\nIt does not work in that case because you can't divide by zero. Also the product of all of the numbers is 0, but the first product returned should not be 0, but rather 24!\nI think this will also fail if some of the numbers are negative.\nLet's try.\n\n\nNegative numbers do not break this. So, here are some of the edge cases identified so far which need to be in our testing.\n\nThe number 0 is included\nOne or more numbers is negative\nThe list only has 1 number\nThe list has no numbers\n\nGame plan\n\nCreate some test cases and grading code\nCreate a naïve implementation that is definitely not optimized, but hopefully will not fall victim to the 0 and negative number issue identified from using division, which I only tried beccause of the follow-up in the question.\nMaybe see if I can create a division implementation that does not fall victim to these issues\nSee if I casn think of anything more efficient\nUse AI to see how close or far I got from the optimal answer (I'm not doing any research or using external tools until this - otherwise this will not really help prepare me for a real coding interview - ick)\n\nTest cases and grading code\n\nNaïve implementation\nFor this, I'm just going to perform the mutiplication for each step. I will need to exclude the current number from the list.\nI'm not going to try anything fancy here or even to use great data structures...\n\nThat's embarrassing... I did not even return anything. 🤦\n\nI am not off to a great start here. Notice that only the last number is the only one that is right. The only test case that passed was [].\nI can easily fix the edge case with just one number by just detecting that at the beginning. I don't need to calculate the length twice, even though that is not really a big performance issue.\nThe main algorithm; however, is flawed. I need to figure out what is wrong. Sure, I could go through this and pretend I am a computer, but since I have a computer, let's just use trusty old print...\n\nOk, color me embarrassed once more. The problem was the break. It should have been continue. I was just dumping out of the inner loop.\n\nMuch better. I still flubbed the two edge cases, but at least the other tests are working. Huzzah. Look at that, I was testing for numbers_length == 0 when I needed to test for if numbers_length == 1. Even the comment indicated that.\n\nMuch better. My first passing one. Does this count as having done the challenge? I did not use division.\nDivision implementation which does not fall victim to the edge cases\nTo do this, I am going to need to look out for a few things.\n\nIf the number is a 0, will need to get the product of all other numbers.\nIf there is only 1 number, return [0]\nIf there are no numbers, return []\n\nPseudo-code\n\nGet length of input numbers\nCheck for 3 and 4, return the appropriate reponse if either condition\nGet the product of all numbers\nGo through each number, divide the product of all numbers by this number\n\n\nArgh! Forgot about the divide by zero edge case. What do I need to do there? Let me look at an example from the test cases with a 0...\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] which should return [24, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So, essentially, if the number we are currently working on is 0 then there is a nonzero product (as long as there are no other 0).\nThe product of all is going to be 0, so, in this kind of scenario I am assuming we need just need the product of every other number minus this one. It makes this division route seem not as nice; however, there would still be fewer mathematical operations, I guess.\nBut now we need to keep the index too. I think there is a construct in Python to get the index and item without having to do alength call and using the range. That would be so much cleaner. I am going to allow myself to cheat on this aspect and research it.\n\nAll tests are now passing for the division way of doing it as well.\nWhat does Qwen2.5-coder think?\n\n\n\nCertainly! Let's analyze your solutions in terms of time complexity and then discuss their efficiency and\nreadability. We'll also explore a more optimal solution.\nAnalysis of Your Solutions\nFirst Solution: Without Division\n\nTime Complexity:\n\nThe outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the input list.\nThe inner loop also runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop.\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n^2)).\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity is (O(1)) extra space (excluding the output list), as we are only using a few\nvariables.\n\nComments:\n\nThis solution works correctly but is inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.\nIt is straightforward and easy to understand, which is good for educational purposes.\n\nSecond Solution: With Division\n\nTime Complexity:\n\nCalculating the total product p_all takes (O(n)).\nFor each element, if it is zero, calculating the product of the rest of the elements takes (O(n)). This\nmeans in the worst case (when there are multiple zeros), this could be inefficient.\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n^2)) in the worst case due to handling multiple zeros.\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity is (O(1)) extra space (excluding the output list).\n\nComments:\n\nThis solution is more efficient than nested loops when there are no zeros, but it becomes inefficient with\nzeros.\nIt uses division, which is not allowed by the follow-up constraint.\n\nOptimal Solution Without Division\nTo solve this problem without using division and achieve a better time complexity, we can use prefix and\nsuffix products. Here's how:\n\nPrefix Product: Calculate the product of all elements to the left of each element.\nSuffix Product: Calculate the product of all elements to the right of each element.\nResult Calculation: Multiply the corresponding prefix and suffix products for each element.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only traverse the list a few times, resulting in linear time complexity.\n\nTime Complexity:\n\nCalculating prefix products takes (O(n)).\nCalculating suffix products takes (O(n)).\nConstructing the result array takes (O(n)).\nTherefore, the overall time complexity is (O(n)).\n\nSpace Complexity:\n\nThe space complexity is (O(n)) due to the additional prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nComments on Optimal Solution\n\nThis solution is efficient with a linear time complexity.\nIt avoids using division, adhering to the follow-up constraint.\nWhile it uses extra space for prefix and suffix products, this can be further optimized by modifying the\ninput array in place or using a single result array to store intermediate results.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nYour initial solutions were correct but not optimal. The optimal solution using prefix and suffix products\nis both efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.\nMy conclusion\nI would have never figured out the O(n) solution. I still need to step through it and understand it better, but I need to head out shortly.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-2/","title":"Daily Coding Problem: Problem #2"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-3/":{"body":"This is\nDaily Coding Problem #3. I did the work in a Jupyter\nnotebook and then exported it to include here.\n\n\nDaily Coding Problem\nProblem #3 (Medium)\nThis problem was asked by Google.\nGiven the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.\nFor example, given the following Node class\n\nThe following test should pass:\n\nMy Thoughts\nI am going to need to implement two methods. The first takes a tree and serializes it into\na string. The second takes a string and deserializes it into a tree.\nI'll probably want to write the deserialize code first. It might make it easier to test.\nI also want to reformat the test that should pass to make it easier to parse with my brain. Here goes:\n\nLooking at this, I wonder if the right side of the tree can just be completely ignored? Then I could just traverse the tree by continually going left. It seems weird to go left instead of right, but I feel that is what the example is telling me to do.\nI don't think a grader is needed here. I should be able to define a string, deserialize it, then serialize the deserialized output. If this output is the same as the original string, I think that means it worked as expected... actually, there is one more issue. I probably need to break the text at word boundaries. There would likely also need to be a test to see if I created the correct number of nodes.\nCommon code\nI probably should do some common setup. How about the following:\n\ndefine base Node class to be used by all code\ncreate a way to count all nodes when traversing left\n\n\nGo for it\nHere goes nothing\n\n\nThoughts while I was creating the code above.\nIf I divide based on spaces in deserialize and then add those spaces back in serialize, then this could lead the output to not be exactly the same as the input if the nodes were constructed manually. The question did not say we would always get the node structure from our own deserialize code.\nIt is important that what goes in is the same as what comes out. So I can make deserialize really simple and then create some nested test cases for serialize.\nThe serialize code needs more testing. Will it left traverse properly when there are a lot more nodes?\n\n\nTime for the Qwen2.5-coder critique!\n\n\nYour current implementation of serialize and deserialize functions doesn't fully meet the requirements\nof the problem. Let's analyze the issues:\nIssues in Your Implementation\n\n\nIncorrect Deserialization:\n\nYour deserialize function creates a tree with only one node (the root) and sets its left child to a\nsingle node containing the entire serialized string, which is incorrect.\n\n\n\nIncorrect Serialization:\n\nThe serialize function only traverses the left subtree of the tree and collects values in a linear\nfashion. This means it completely ignores the right subtree and also doesn't handle the structure of the\ntree correctly.\n\n\n\nEdge Cases Not Covered:\n\nYour implementation does not cover edge cases such as trees with no nodes, single-node trees, or trees\nwith mixed structures (both left and right children).\n\n\n\nBig O Complexity:\n\nSince your traversal is linear in nature, it only handles a subset of the tree structure. The\ncomplexity cannot be accurately determined from this partial implementation.\n\n\n\nCorrect Approach\nA common approach to serialize and deserialize binary trees is to use pre-order or level-order traversal\nmethods. Here's an optimal way to solve the problem using pre-order traversal with handling None nodes\n(which represent missing children):\n\nExplanation\n\n\nSerialization:\n\nWe use a pre-order traversal to serialize the tree.\nIf we encounter a None node, we append \"None,\" to indicate that there's no child at this position.\n\n\n\nDeserialization:\n\nWe split the serialized string by commas and convert it into an iterator for easy traversal.\nWe use a recursive helper function to reconstruct the tree from the list of values. If the value is\n\"None\", we return None; otherwise, we create a new node with the given value and recursively build its\nleft and right children.\n\n\n\nBig O Complexity:\n\nBoth serialization and deserialization have a time complexity of (O(n)), where (n) is the number of\nnodes in the tree.\nThe space complexity is also (O(n)) due to the recursion stack during traversal.\n\n\n\nThis implementation covers all edge cases, including empty trees, single-node trees, and complex trees with\nvarious structures.\n\nMy response\n\nThe original problem never stated how it should be deserialized. I do not think my approach is incorrect in the context of the problem. It was never stated you could not just stuff all values into a single node. That was easiest, so I did it. It probably is incorrect in the context of computer science though.\n\nThe example in the problem completely ignored the value of the node to the root's right. I needed to make my code conform to the example. These questions are all weird and contrived. So, I figured my answer could be as well.\n\n\nSingle node trees: excluded due to example. The text root was not returned in the output\nMixed structure trees: deliberately excluded.\n\nTree with no nodes? Let's test...\n\n\nThe Qwen correct approach is making the assumption we will have comma separated values. I do not think that is a safe assumption to make. It also would have led to a single node with all the text in it just like my solution as the input text did not contain commas.\nTakeaway\nWhile my answer did work, I do need to learn more about the proper computer science way to handle trees of text.\nQwen-2.5-coder on handling text in trees\n\n\nCertainly! Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used for a wide range of applications\ndue to their hierarchical nature and efficiency in various operations. Let's delve into how trees can be\nleveraged in computer science, including different types of trees and common tree traversal techniques.\nTypes of Trees\n\n\nBinary Tree:\n\nEach node has at most two children (left and right).\n\n\n\nBinary Search Tree (BST):\n\nA binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the\nright child only nodes with values greater than the parent node.\nThis property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n\n\nBalanced Trees:\n\nExamples include AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.\nThese trees maintain a balanced structure to ensure that operations like search, insert, and delete\nremain (O(\\log n)).\n\n\n\nB-Trees/B+ Trees:\n\nUsed in databases and file systems due to their ability to store large amounts of data efficiently.\nB-Trees have multiple children, allowing for fewer levels in the tree.\n\n\n\nHeap:\n\nA complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (max-heap or min-heap).\nUsed in priority queues and heapsort.\n\n\n\nTrie:\n\nA tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.\nEfficient for prefix-based searches.\n\n\n\nTree Traversal Techniques\nTree traversal involves visiting all nodes in a tree in a specific order. The most common types of tree\ntraversals are:\n\n\nPre-order Traversal (Root, Left, Right):\n\nVisit the root node first, then recursively visit the left subtree, followed by the right subtree.\n\n\n\nIn-order Traversal (Left, Root, Right):\n\nRecursively visit the left subtree, then visit the root node, and finally visit the right subtree.\nFor BSTs, in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order.\n\n\n\nPost-order Traversal (Left, Right, Root):\n\nRecursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visit the root node.\n\n\n\nLevel-order Traversal:\n\nVisit all nodes level by level from top to bottom.\nImplemented using a queue data structure.\n\n\n\nExample Code for Tree Traversals\nLet's implement a binary tree and demonstrate the different traversal techniques in Python:\n\nExplanation of the Code\n\n\nPre-order Traversal:\n\nVisits the root node first, then recursively visits the left and right subtrees.\nExample output for the given tree: 1 2 4 5 3 6.\n\n\n\nIn-order Traversal:\n\nRecursively visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.\nFor a BST, this will visit nodes in ascending order.\nExample output for the given tree: 4 2 5 1 3 6.\n\n\n\nPost-order Traversal:\n\nRecursively visits the left and right subtrees before visiting the root node.\nUseful for deleting trees (delete children first).\nExample output for the given tree: 4 5 2 6 3 1.\n\n\n\nLevel-order Traversal:\n\nVisits nodes level by level from top to bottom using a queue.\nUseful in breadth-first search algorithms.\nExample output for the given tree: 1 2 3 4 5 6.\n\n\n\nApplications of Trees\n\n\nBinary Search Trees (BSTs):\n\nEfficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with average time complexity (O(\\log n)).\n\n\n\nHeaps:\n\nUsed in priority queues and implementing efficient sorting algorithms like heapsort.\n\n\n\nBalanced Trees (AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees):\n\nMaintain balance to ensure efficient operations even in the worst case ((O(\\log n))).\n\n\n\nTries:\n\nEfficient prefix-based searches for strings.\n\n\n\nExpression Trees:\n\nUsed to represent expressions and evaluate them efficiently.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nTrees are a versatile data structure with numerous applications across various domains of computer science.\nUnderstanding different types of trees and traversal techniques is crucial for designing efficient\nalgorithms and data management systems. The examples provided demonstrate how to implement and use these\ntraversals in Python, which can be adapted to more complex tree structures and applications.\n\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-3/","title":"Daily Coding Problem: Problem #3"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/diving-into-ai/":{"body":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm.

This means I need to run all of the models locally. Here I will document what I\nhave done, and why. I hope this information helps you and also helps future me.\nComputer\nTo run the models quickly, I need a pretty capable machine to run them on.\nI have chosen one with an Apple M4 processor and ample RAM. The main reasons I went\nwith an M4 are:\n\nI already use MacOS as my daily driver. I'd rather get a machine I can use for more than\njust running AI models.\nThe unified memory architecture allows the system to share memory between the processor\nand the GPUs. This should allow me to do more with less.\n\nOllama\nI start my journey with Ollama. It is the local AI gateway drug.\nInstallation is a breeze:\n\nGo to ollama.com/download\nDownload installer\nRun installer\n\nRunning models is simple\n\nollama run model_name\n\nI try a bunch of models including:\n\nllama3.2\nllama3.3\nqwen2.5\n\nI find Ollama amazing. The people who worked on this did a fantastic job. It just worked. Perfectly.\nThe downside for my particular goal of learning more about AI is I do not get to see the\ngnarly stuff that makes this all work.\nNote: Ollama keeps a local history of what you send in ~/.ollama/history. If you would like to\ntemporarily disable this, send /set nohistory first before anything you do not want saved.\nNo history will be saved after that for the current session.\nGetting Into the Weeds\nTo really see how to leverage local AI, I need to work at a lower level. I want to go through the\nDive into Deep Learning book. The\ninstallation instructions involve making global\nchanges to my machine. I read that different AI/ML libraries often require different versions\nof python. I want to be able to create little mini-environments for each of my AI experiments.\nI could go the route of Docker/podman containers,\nbut I've already done that before. There are also articles detailing the difficulties getting\ncontainers to be able to access GPUs.\nDown the Nix Rabbithole\nWith my old computer, I leveraged Homebrew to install all of the tools\nI was going to use. I really liked Homebrew, but it installs things globally. What I need\nis a tool which can install things either globally or locally. I am choosing use the\nNix Package Manager because it\npretty much does that.\nThe nix develop or nix-shell commands can create a bash shell that has certain libraries\navailable to it. When you exit the shell, poof they're gone. (Well not really, they still\nare there taking up disk space somewhere, but your global configuration has not changed.)\nConfusion\nI definitely find Nix a bit confusing. At this point in my journey I am starting to wonder if I\nbit off more than I can chew. First off, Nix can refer to one of 3 things:\n\nNix, the programming language\nNix, the package manager\nNixOS, the operating system\n\nI will use Nix, the package manager which you can get from nixos.org. Once more, it\nis confusing that you get the package manager from a site with a name ending in os. I will put that\naside. In the rest of this post Nix refers to the package manager.\nSecond, there are some splits in the Nix community. The first is whether to use\nNix flakes. The second is whether to use the\nNix command instead of having different commands\nfor each function (ie nix build instead of nix-build).\nThird, there are multiple ways to install it on MacOS:\n\nnixos site\nDeterminate Nix Installer\n\nnote: I do not recommend piping the output from curl into sh. Instead, download the\ninstallation script, inspect it, and then run the downloaded copy.\nNix Package Manager Installation\nI will use the Determinate Nix Installer.\nThe main reason I am choosing this is because it has an uninstaller and looks like it is more\nlikely to survive OS upgrades. It also enables Nix flakes and\nNix command. I plan to leverage flakes. This\nmight not be the right choice, I am but a Nix n00b, but their promise of \"improving reproducibility\nof Nix installations\" sounds nice. When I first started using ZFS,\nI loved how everything used the same command. It made it easy to discover all the different subcommands\nand their options. This makes Nix command sound appealing.\nI am not nuts about how many changes it will make to my system,\nbut at least they are clearly spelled out and reversible.\nI follow the steps to install Nix using the shell installer without installing determinate.\nI did download the script, inspect it, and then run it. This all goes off without a hitch.\nnix-darwin Installation\nI decide also to install nix-darwin. This lets me\ncontrol some of the settings on my computer declaratively using a Nix flake. Doing this\nis not really related to setting up a machine for running AI models, but it sounds nice\nto be able to make certain system-level changes.\nI follow the steps at\nnixcademy.com/posts/nix-on-macos/.\nand end up with this flake:\n\nI really like this configuration. The only setting that is not working\nis trying to default the Finder to column view. My research indicates\nApple took the ability to default to column view out of Sequoia.\nIf you'd like to use my configuration, you will need to change line 64\nto reflect the hostname of your system.\nDive Into Deep Learning book\nThe prerequisites are now in place. I download the pytorch code.\n\nNow I am going to leverage Nix to create a local shell with everything that's\nneeded. I am using a Nix flake. This may not have been the right choice as\nmost examples on the web are for nix-shell. But I'm stubborn and I finally get\nit working after lots of frustration.\nI create a flake.nix file in the pytorch directory.\n\nIt turns out that I probably would have needed much less boiler-plate if I had gone\nthe nix-shell route.\nTo use this, open Terminal and change to the pytorch directory. The first time\nyou run this you must add it to git with git add flake.nix. Then run\nnix develop. This command, along with the flake takes care of everything. Your default\nweb browser will pop up in Jupyter lab and you're ready to follow along.\nWhere Next?\nOnce I have a better sense of the fundamentals I will likely explore various libraries.\nNext on my list is Hugging Face's Transformer library.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/diving-into-ai/","title":"Diving into AI"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/farm-life-rendering-beeswax/":{"body":"My wife, the animal lover, got us into beekeeping several years ago. I had no idea how\nmuch I would like bees then. This weekend, after processing honey, I decided I wanted\nto render and filter the remaining wax. This is the first time I have ever done anything\nlike this.\nResearch\nInitial Questions\nMy first step is always a little bit of research.\n\nWhat is the process?\nWhat temperature does beeswax melt at?\nWhat are some products one can make out of beeswax?\nIs there anything to watch out for or be careful about?\n\nWhat is the process?\nWhat I could see from my research is that all of the techniques involve melting the wax first. Then there are one or more filtering steps. Finally, the purified wax is filled into a form or used to create a product.\nDifferent sites had slightly different variations. The main differences I could see were:\n\nWhere the initial melting step should be performed.\nWhat kind of filtering medium to use.\n\nThe initial melting step could be performed directly in a double boiler. Then the melted wax is poured over some kind of filter and the filtered wax drips through into another container. If the wax does not come out clean enough, then the step can be repeated.\nThe other option is to surround the wax in some sort of water-resistant filter medium. Then dunk it in a pot of water that is at the correct temperature. The wax then filters through as it melts. Once all of the wax is melted, tongs can be used to squeeze the last of the wax through the filter medium into the pot. The pot is then allowed to cool. Since wax is lighter than water, a disk of wax forms on the surface of the water.\nTo filter the wax, I saw a variety of different materials being used including:\n\ncheese cloth\nmuslin\nold t-shirts\npaper towels\n\nWhat temperature does beeswax melt at?\nBeeswax melts at around 145º F or 63º C. It has a relatively high melting point for a wax. This gives it some serious staying power. It also makes it really difficult to clean up.\nWhat are some products one can make out of beeswax?\nIt seems like the products fall into some broad categories:\n\ncandles\ncosmetics\npolish (wood polish, clothes waterproofing, rust prevention)\nlubrication (wood drawer slides, sewing thread)\ncrayons\nfood preservation (used as a food safe coating)\n\nThe cosmetics and the polish are essentially made the same way. Mix the beeswax with oil in a certain ratio. Then heat it up gently, mix it well, and pour it into its final container or mold.\nIs there anything to watch out for or be careful about?\nThe two main things to watch out for are:\n\nMake sure not to get hot wax on you. It will solidify on your skin and may burn you.\nThe internet says if beeswax is heated too long or too hot, its color will change from a yellow to more of a brown.\n\nExtracting and Purifying the Beeswax\nSince this is my first time doing this, I want to make it as easy as possible. So I use the following questions to guide my decisions:\n\nWhat can I do to make the least mess possible?\nHow can I use the smallest amount of kitchenware?\nIs there a way to eliminate some of the steps?\n\nThe wax is already in a cheesecloth-like fabric. We used that to extract the honey since we do not have one of those centrifugal honey extracting machines. I put the fabric-encased wax into a pot and slowly bring the water up to temperature. I do not have a candy thermometer as one of the articles suggested, so I just use a meat thermometer.\nIt takes a while for the wax to start melting, but indeed it does. When I think that all the wax is melted, I pick up the cheesecloth bag, and use tongs to carefully squeeze out the rest of the wax. Then I let the pot cool and the wax hardens on the surface of the water creating a disk. This makes minimal mess in the pot. Just a little ring around the top.\nThere are some impurities in the wax disk. I think my filtering medium was not fine enough.  If I were to do it again, I would put it in double cheese cloth. This way, I could avoid an additional filtering step. The other thing I would've done is not worried as much about the temperature. It took a really long time to melt. I was likely overly cautious.\nSince there are some impurities, I decide to perform an additional filtering step. So much for not using a lot of kitchenware! Unfortunately, I have run out of cheese cloth. The other thing my research calls for is a double boiler. I also do not have one of those. Not a problem. I put the wax in a mason jar, boil water in a pot, and put the mason jar in the pot. The wax melts and I can see all the impurities floating about.\nI decide to use paper towels instead of cheese cloth to filter the wax. I put paper towels over another glass container and then pour the melted wax in. It slowly drains through. The filtered liquid looks great! I pour some of the wax into a soap form. The rest I use in a ratio of three parts olive oil to one part beeswax to create a salve.\nThis was all a lot easier than I expected. There is definitely a lot of gatekeeping on the Internet. While it may be true that there are ways to do it better, I think you can get 90% of the way there without specialized tools or great technique.\nHow is the salve? It is a little hard and kind of greasy, but it has staying power. I like it so far. It is kind of the same as a wood polish. I’m not sure olive oil is a great oil to use in wood polish though as it could go rancid. 🤷‍♂️\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/farm-life-rendering-beeswax/","title":"Farm Life: Rendering Beeswax"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/foray-into-agentic-ai/":{"body":"I spoke with someone who is tasked with implementing AI systems at their organization.\nThe goal, for them, is to use AI to help fetch and format data in response to natural\nlanguage queries. Someone could ask, for example:\n\nCompare the number of widgets sold in 2024 and 2025. Break down the data by quarter.\nPresent the data in both a table as well as a line chart.\n\nThe way they are able to accomplish this is by leveraging agentic AI.\nWhat is Agentic AI\n\n\nAgentic AI refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are capable\nof autonomous decision-making and action, often with a degree of\nself-directedness or goal-oriented behavior. The term \"agentic\" comes from\nthe word \"agent,\" which in this context means an entity that can act\nindependently to achieve its goals.\nAgentic AI systems are designed to perceive their environment, reason\nabout it, and take actions that influence their surroundings. They may be\nable to learn from experience, adapt to changing situations, and make\ndecisions based on their own objectives, rather than simply following\npre-programmed instructions.\n...\n\nThat sounds great, but does not help much here. What I am really looking to find out\nis how it works.\nHere we go again...\n\nThis yields similar text which does not really help me much. But it sounds great!\n\nThe response is not helpful. That was a bit of a waste of time.\nIn my conversation the other day, I learned that you create tools the AI can leverage\nto interact with the world. For example, you could create a tool for searching the web\nor a tool to perform mathematical operations. The AI needs to know about the existence\nof these tools and what they are for. Then it is either trained to or somehow figures out\non its own when and how to use the tools.\nOpen Deep Research\nOpenAI recently created OpenAI Deep Research\nwhich can autonomously research your questions by searching the web. Shortly thereafter\nthe Hugging Face community came out with\nOpen Deep Research which purports to do the\nsame thing. Just for funsies, I would like to get Open Deep Research running locally. Then\nI would like to ask it to research this area for me.\nNote: This section is long and meandering. Feel free to skip to the results\nif a play by play is not your idea of fun.\nSetup\n\nNow I have the code. I'm going to set up a shell with python and all of the requirements\nusing a Nix flake just as I did in Diving into AI.\nI put the following in a file called flake.nix in the open_deep_research directory.\n\nNote: Nix allows flakes to be composed. At some point, I may be able to create a flake\nwith most of the boilerplate. Then I can have flakes in my individual projects that import it,\nand mostly just need to have the specific differences needed for that project. I may get to that\nat some point, but I am not sure if I want to do that. It adds more complication. Sometimes it is\nnice for an entity to stand alone. Even if there is more boilerplate.\nNow I run nix develop and I get the error:\n\nWhen nix is running out of a directory that is a git repository, it will only see files\nthat are added to the git repository. It does not need the changes to be committed, and you\ndo not have to git add again if you change the flake. It would be nice if this error\nmessage could be improved to provide a bit more guidance for the end user.\nI run git add flake.nix. Now nix develop works, the dependencies are installed,\nand I have the bash shell in front of me. Time to see if it works.\n\nI'm surprised that is not in the requirements.txt. When I look at the visual_vs_textbrowser.ipynb file, it starts with the line !pip install \"smolagents[litellm]\" -q. I modify the flake to install the optional smolagents with\nthe optional litellm dependency pip install \"smolagents[litellm]\" -r requirements.txt.\nSecond try.\n\nThere are two issues here. The first is that ffmpeg is not available. For that, I just add\na line with pkgs.ffmpeg to the buildInputs section. The second issue may be related to\nthis bug report. It turns out the\nsmolagents library has changes in the branch we checked out from what is published to the net.\nAt the time of this writing, this code has been out for only 3 days. We need to install the\nversion of the library in this branch.\nI change the flake.nix to have pip install -e ../.. -r requirements.txt. This tells\npip to install smolagents in development mode from the root of the git repository we cloned\nas well as the requirements needed for open deep research.\n\nThis is great except why do I need a token to have it log in to Hugging Face? My goal is\nto run it completely locally. Time to dig into the code in run.py to see what is\nhappening.\nIt turns out there is a benchmarking dataset called gaia-benchmark/GAIA. I really do not have\nany interest in running the benchmark. I look more deeply at the file and it is completely built\naround these test datasets. I could probably modify run.py to do what I want; however, there\nare Jupyter notebook files I can examine first.\nModify the code to run the model locally and use my prompts rather than those from the benchmark\nI'm going to use Jupyter while figuring this all out. To do that, I modify the flake.nix file\nto install and run Jupyter. To make it a bit better than in my previous post\nDiving into AI, I made it not run jupyter if\ndependency installation fails. Otherwise, there could be a failure you don't notice\ncausing you to bang your head on the wall trying to figure\nout why nothing is working. Here is the relevant part.\n\nNow when I run nix develop jupyter lab opens. I look at both analysis.ipynb and visual_vs_text_browser.ipynb\nand they also are doing the same thing to a certain degree. I know at this point that I should really\ngo back to the start, examine LangChain/LangGraph, smolagents, and then find what other libraries. But,\nfranky, I find this fun.\nThe game plan? Create a new Jupyter notebook with snippets from existing code and try to figure out how\nit all fits together. In the end, I get it to work running locally.\nHere is the flake.nix so far\n\nHere is the python code I have so far. I have this in a jupyter notebook, but you could\njust as easily put it in a .py file and run it. (If you do that, you can edit the flake to not launch\nJupyter or exit on its own.)\n\nThis code all comes from run.py. I made some changes to run the model locally instead\nof calling an API to a cloud provider. I also removed all of the parts that rely on\nthe GAIA benchmark. My goal here is to be able to ask a question and then have it go out\nand research the answer.\nThere are still two large problems at this point:\n\nIt is using the CPU, not the GPU. I will need to try to get it to use the MPS\n(Metal Performance Shaders), if possible.\nI am getting this error:\n\n\nThere is no EiffelTowerHeight.txt file. inspect_file_as_text refers to the 'TextInspectorTool'\nclass in scripts/text_inspector_tool.py. I think the model just does not understand that the\nfile is not actually present. Maybe it would work around this if allowed to run long enough,\nor I may need to use a different model.\nGet it running on the GPU\nFirst I write a method that returns the most appropriate device to have pytorch use.\nYou'll need to also add import torch with the rest of the imports for the code\nbelow to work.\n\nThen, we need to modify the code creating the smolagent model to pass the device down the\nstack to Pytorch. This is easy. In method answer_single_question change the first\nline to model = TransformersModel(model_id, device_map=get_device()).\nSuccess!\nFix the error with the text_inspector_tool\nThe error I am seeing is coming from src/smolagents/agents.py in the step method of\nMultiStepAgent when it is calling fix_final_answer_code(parse_code_blobs(model_output)).\nI notice that the output of the model appears to be getting cut off. Changing the first line\nin answer_single_question to\nmodel = TransformersModel(model_id, device_map=get_device(), max_new_tokens=8192) solves\nthis problem.\nNow the problem I am encountering is that to search Google the serpapi is being used\nand this requires an API key. My plan is to modify this to use DuckDuckGo search.\nChange to using Duck Duck Go search\nRight now it is using serpapi to use Google search. This needs an API key and\nrelies on an intermediary between us and the search. I am going to experiment\nwith addressing this in two ways:\n\nModify the code to just perform a regular DuckDuckGo search\nUse a Python library that hits the DuckDuckGo search API\n\nPerform a regular Duck Duck Go Search\nIn scripts/text_web_browser.py I change line 389 from\nself.browser.visit_page(f\"google: {query}\", filter_year=filter_year)\n\nThis is likely not going to be as good as structured output, but these LLMs\noften surprise me with their capacity to do unstructured tasks.\nI notice that as each step completes, the RAM utilization of the Python process\ngoes up. There is likely a bug in my code where the model is getting loaded for each step\nrather than just staying loaded. I should not be using 70GB for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.\nIt also significantly slows down on step 2. Maybe because it has so much more context.\nIt did work in the end though when I asked How high is the Eiffel Tower?. When\nI asked a more complicated question Compare and contrast the differences between the various Python libraries to implement agentic AI, it ended up running out of\nmemory before it couls could complete.\n\nI may need to use a smaller model on this machine unless I figure out a way to reduce memory utilization.\nAdditionally, I keep seeing the error:\n\nThe agent does autonomously figure out it needs to pass request into search_agent instead of query. It\nwould be nicer if it did not have to have an extra step. This could potnetially be accomplished by either:\nFixing the code so the first call to search_agent has the correct parameter\nI followed the code and it looks like it is MultiStepAgent.__call__ that expects the request\nparameter. ToolCallingAgent extends this class, and in my code I am creating a ToolCallingAgent.\n\nshow_agents_descriptions in the code refers to there needing to be a parameter called request,\nwhich is used by format_prompt_with_managed_agents_descriptions which is in turn used to create\na system prompt in MultiStepAgent.initialize_system_prompt, which itself is called in MultiStepAgent.run\nand CodeAgent.run. CodeAgent has its own initialize_system_prompt method, but it calls\nsuper().initialize_system_prompt and just replaces {{authorized_imports}}.\nThis looks like a chicken and egg problem. The prompt is not modified until a step runs. The step\nruns after the planning stage. Once the first step runs, the system prompt now reflects that the parameter\nis request and the LLM adjusts accordingly. I may have analyzed this incorrectly, but if I get this right,\nthen it stands to reason that I need a system prompt earlier in the game to reflect the correct parameter\nto pass to search_agent.\nIn my answer_single_question function, I modify augmented_question to contain The search_agent tool requires a parameter called 'request'. This works. The first call to search_agent uses the request\nparameter. This small change might drastically reduce the amount of steps needed. Let's see if my more\ncomplex question can be completed now.\nStep 3 has an issue. I saw this on the previous run, so it is not a result of the most recent small change.\n\nI think, based on the error, the LLM will be able to figure out it needs to use double quotes instead\nof single quotes to create valid JSON. Although, I'm kind of with the AI on this one. If it is constructing\nPython to run, it seems single quotes would be appropriate.\nIt really bogs down on step 4. I am almost definitely going to need to use a smaller model for these\nkinds of multi-step queries. I stop it and run it with Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct instead. This\nis a significantly smaller model. It may be too small, but I want this to run faster so I\ncan iterate much quicker.\nQwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct does not appear to be up to the task.\n\nThen it moves on to step 1 and sort of gets stuck there. I'm not sure if it would eventually\nrecover because I stop it pretty quickly. It did not come up with a plan to follow and it does\nnot look like the Open Depp Seek code likes that. This migth be an edge case.\nThe second run produced this initial plan and then got stuck:\n\nuser\nPlan: Compare and contrast the differences between the various Python libraries to implement agentic AI\nOutput: {\n'agent_learning_libraries': ['PyTorch', 'Keras', 'TensorFlow'],\n'ai_rights': ['DeepMind', 'IBM Watson', 'Google DeepMind', 'Microsoft Cognitive Services', 'IBM Watson AI\nEngine'],\n'competitive_libraries': ['OpenAI GPT-4', 'GPT-3', 'BERT', 'EleutherAI/MNIST-10B', 'Stanford NLP'],\n'deprecated_libraries': [],\n'free_libraries': ['PyPI', 'Pypi', 'GitHub', 'Bitbucket', 'Docker Hub']\n}\n\nTrying again with Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct. My initial run was with version 2.\nThis is 2.5 with the same number of parameters. It had always been my intention to use version 2.5\nas this is the same model as we used at the beginning with fewer parameters.\nThis one is not working either. Let's try a qwen2.5 model with more parameters. How\nabout Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct? It looks like it works, but for some reason it is\nspecifying that the searches are to limit the results to 2023. Maybe 2023 is the current year\naccording to Qwen? Regardless, this means the analysis is going to be dated. It ends up\ntaking way too long. This seems to happen after the initial DuckDuckGo search.\nSearch DuckDuckGo using a library\nI think having more structured search data could make the context smaller, leading to\nfaster execution. It might also allow the AI to make better use of the search results.\nI'll try using the duckduckgo_search library.\nFirst, I modify flake.nix to install the library. I try hard to set things up in\na way where, if someone else uses this, it is more likely to work right off the\nbat. Otherwise I would just run pip install duckduckgo_search and be done.\n\nSince I will be making a lot of changes, I copy scripts/text_web_browser.py to\nscripts/text_web_browser_ddg.py. I then update the import in the main code I've been\nworking on from from scripts.text_web_browser import ( to from scripts.text_web_browser_ddg import (.\nThe main changes I make are:\n\nRemove _serpapi_search method\nRemove all references to the serpapi_key\nModify the set_address method to check for ddg: instead of google: and call self._ddg_search instead\nModify the _split_pages method to check for ddg: instead of google:\nImplement the _ddg_search method below\n\n\nQwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct just can not figure out how to convert the descriptions of the\narguments for a tool into the proper Python format. I need to switch back to\nQwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and see if the memory utilization is reduced by using\nthe DuckDuckGo search library.\n\nThe same problem happens with Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and there are some issues\nwith my _ddg_search method. I will get to the bottom of these problems.\nSince the model is just calling the tools, I figure I can iterate more quickly on fixing the issue\nby creating some code that directly does the same thing. That way I don't have to wait for the model to do it.\n\nThe code easily replicated the problem.\n\nThis error makes complete sense. The results are a list of dictionaries. Since the data is\nnicely machine readable, I should return the results to the agent as JSON.\nI modify text_web_browser_ddg.py to import json. Then I makr the following change:\n\nNow I'm getting two successful web searches and then it starts failing with the following\nmessage.\n\nI'm definitely closer.\nAddressing the elphant in the room - memory utilization\nThis is never going to run successfully on my local machine if the python process ends up chewing\nup 90+ GB of virtual memory. I watched a video last night which may have given me a clue\n(AI Agent Fundamentals in 21 Minutes - Tina Huang). It is likely\nthat the model is running multiple times. One for the main agent and then other times for the\nsubagents it is delgating to. Would it be possible to unload a model that is not currently\nbeing used, but retain its context? Let's see.\nTo figure this out, I need to dig more into the smolagent code. At this point I do not\nreally have a great picture of what is going on. For all I know, smolagent has an option\nan option to do this and I have just failed to turn it on.\nCodeAgent does not have an option to do what I want...\n\nIt extends MultiStepAgent. Let's check there.\n\nThat is not what I need. We essentially have a CodeAgent that has a managed_agent which is\na ToolCallingAgent with access to various tools. Maybe what I seek is in ToolCallingAgent?\n\nThat is not helping much either. I am going to really need to dig down and see what is\nhappening. First, I find some places where I was creating duplicate objects in\ncreate_agent_hierarchy. I also modify flake.nix to install memory_profiler\nand annotate the answer_single_question with @profile.\nWhile that runs, I am going to look more at how MultiStepAgent works since this seems\nto be the parent class for the agents we are using.\nI switch to using Ollama directly instead of the Transformers library. Memory\nutilization drops like a rock.

What are their key differences?\n\nUsing qwen2.5:7b\nHere is Qwen2.5:7b's answer:\n\nThought: I have gathered information about libraries used for implementing agentic AI and their key differences.\nNow, I need to summarize the findings as requested:\n\n\nTask outcome (short version):\nSeveral popular libraries are commonly used for implementing agentic AI, including CAMEL, Lyzr,\nAstra-Assistants-API, LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI. These frameworks provide tools for developing autonomous\nagents capable of performing complex tasks.\n\n\nTask outcome (extremely detailed version):\n\n\nCAMEL Framework (αlpha)\n\nDescription: Open-source library designed for studying autonomous and communicative agents.\nDocumentation: Available at https://github.com/slavakurilyak/awesome-ai-agents\nUse Cases: Suitable for researchers aiming to understand the behaviors, capabilities, and potential risks of\nautonomous systems.\n\n\n\nLyzr Framework\n\nDescription: Enterprise-grade AI agent framework designed for easy configuration and deployment.\nDocumentation: Available at https://github.com/juliustago/ai-agents..2\nUse Cases: Ideal for businesses requiring robust and scalable AI agents in enterprise environments.\n\n\n\nAstra-Assistants-API\n\nDescription: Backend implementation of the OpenAI Assistants API, supporting features like persistent\nthreads, files, assistants, and streaming functionalities.\nDocumentation: Details available at https://github.com/slavakurilyak/awesome-ai-agents\nUse Cases: Useful for integrating advanced AI capabilities into applications that require persistent\ncommunication and dynamic data handling.\n\n\n\nLangGraph Framework\n\nDescription: One of the top 3 trending agentic AI frameworks, focusing on multi-agent orchestration.\nDocumentation: Comprehensive comparison available at\nhttps://www.datagrom.com/data-science-machine-learning-ai-blog/langgraph-vs-autogen-vs-crewai-comparison-agentic-ai\n-frameworks\nUse Cases: Suitable for developers building large-scale agentic AI systems with a focus on multi-agent\ncoordination and efficient resource management.\n\n\n\nAutoGen Framework\n\nDescription: Another prominent agentic AI framework, designed to facilitate the development of autonomous\nagents that can handle complex tasks through advanced planning and decision-making mechanisms.\nDocumentation: Available at\nhttps://www.datagrom.com/data-science-machine-learning-ai-blog/langgraph-vs-autogen-vs-crewai-comparison-agentic-ai\n-frameworks\nUse Cases: Ideal for projects requiring highly autonomous agents that can operate effectively in dynamic\nenvironments with minimal human intervention.\n\n\n\nCrewAI Framework\n\nDescription: The third of the top 3 trending agentic AI frameworks, known for its comprehensive approach to\nbuilding and managing multi-agent systems.\nDocumentation: Details available at\nhttps://www.datagrom.com/data-science-machine-learning-ai-blog/langgraph-vs-autogen-vs-crewai-comparison-agentic-ai\n-frameworks\nUse Cases: Suitable for developers working on large-scale projects that require the coordination of multiple\nautonomous agents to achieve complex objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional context (if relevant):\nThe above frameworks and libraries are part of a broader ecosystem of tools designed for implementing agentic\nAI, including Langchain and AI Fairness 360 by IBM, which can be used to ensure ethical development and responsible\ndeployment of these systems.\nFor beginners or those looking for a simpler approach, resources like the GitHub repositories mentioned provide\nextensive documentation and practical examples to get started with developing your own agentic AI agents.\n\n\n\nThis is not bad. The information is useful. The documentation links are not great though. At least\nthey are not the official documentation for each of those libraries.\nUsing llama3.2\nLet's see what the response looks like if I use llama3.2. It seems to have a lot of issues following the instructions.\nIt creates code that is not allowed and then I get errors like this:\n\nI gave up after a little while.\nUsing deepseek-r1:7b\nI try Deepseek-r1 and it has even more issues trying to figure out what to do. It\nessentially keeps returning the same answer which is not Python code. Deepseek-r1:7b\nis one of the distillation models. In this case, Qwen-7b was \"re-trained\" by\nDeepseek.\nUnfortunately, this one completely can not handle the task at hand.\nUsing phi4\nI try Phi 4 and this goes much better than llama3.2 or deepseek-r1:4b. Its\nresearch approach appears sound and it is properly formatting python code\nto call the tools.\nTo be completely fair, this is a 14 billion parameter model. All the others were\n7 billion. If this goes well, I will also try it with qwen2.5:14b. Just so no\none looks at this and says Phi4 is so much better than Qwen when it was an\nunfair comparison.\nHere is Phi4's answer:\n\nTo provide an accurate and comprehensive response to the question regarding libraries available for implementing agentic AI and their key differences, a detailed analysis has been conducted. Here is a concise summary of the findings:\nKey Libraries for Agentic AI\n\n\nMicrosoft AutoGen\n\nDescription: An open-source framework designed to build and coordinate multi-agent conversational systems.\nKey Features:\n\nSupports dynamic collaboration among agents, allowing roles adjustment based on real-time demands.\nFacilitates modular architecture for maintainable processes.\n\n\nUse Cases: Best suited for applications that require a flexible and maintainable structure.\n\n\n\nOpenAI Swarm\n\nDescription: An experimental multi-agent framework by OpenAI focusing on team-based task delegation among agents.\nKey Features:\n\nImplements a multi-agent design pattern for efficient task delegation.\nPromotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability in AI systems.\n\n\nUse Cases: Ideal for educational purposes and projects needing fluid collaboration among agents.\n\n\n\nComparative Analysis\nFeatureMicrosoft AutoGenOpenAI Swarm\nDesign FocusMulti-agent conversational systems.Team-based multi-agent orchestration framework.\nDynamic CollaborationAllows agents to adjust roles based on real-time task demands.Facilitates task delegation among agents using shared message contexts.\nModularity &amp; ScalabilityEmphasizes modular architecture for maintainable processes.Promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability in AI systems.\nUse CasesApplications requiring flexible and maintainable structure.Educational examples of multi-agent systems; projects needing fluid collaboration.\nCommunity SupportActive GitHub repository; extensive documentation.Experimental framework with growing community support.\n\nRecommendations\n\nMicrosoft AutoGen: Recommended for developing complex, flexible AI-driven conversational systems that require dynamic agent interactions.\nOpenAI Swarm: Suitable for educational purposes and scenarios where task delegation among agents in a collaborative environment is essential.\n\nFinal Answer\nFINAL ANSWER:\n\n\nMicrosoft AutoGen:\n\nOpen-source framework\nMulti-agent conversational systems\nDynamic collaboration\nModular architecture\n\n\n\nOpenAI Swarm:\n\nExperimental multi-agent framework\nTeam-based task delegation\nModularity and scalability\nEducational use cases\n\n\n\n\nIt is not lost on me that Microsoft's model recommended a library created by Microsoft.\nThis output is pretty good, but it really only dug into two libraries. My preference\nso far is for qwen2.5:7b. What can qwen2.5:14b do?\nUsing qwen2.5:14b\nLet's see how the 14 billion parameter Qwen2.5 model stacks up to the 7 billion\nparameter version I used earlier.\nHere is Qwen2.5:14b's answer.\n\nBased on the information gathered by the search agent, I have compiled a list of popular Python libraries used for\nagentic AI along with their key features and functionalities.\nTask Outcome (Short Version):\nListed several popular Python libraries used for agentic AI.\nTask Outcome (Detailed Version):\n\n\nTensorFlow:\n\nIntroduction: Developed by Google for numerical computation and machine learning.\nFeatures: Supports deep learning, reinforcement learning, generative models.\nWide-ranging applications from natural language processing to computer vision.\nFunctionality: Offers extensive documentation and a large community of developers.\nUse Cases: Applicable in industries ranging from finance to healthcare.\n\n\n\nLangChain (Langchain):\n\nIntroduction: An open-source framework simplifying LLM application development.\nFeatures: Integration with OpenAI API and Hugging Face Transformers.\nSupports memory, retrieval, and agent-based systems.\nFunctionality: Enables seamless creation of applications powered by large language models.\nUse Cases: Commonly used in chatbot development and customer service.\n\n\n\nPhidata:\n\nIntroduction: A lightweight framework for building multi-modal agents from LLMs.\nFeatures: Conversion of LLMs into specialized AI assistants.\nSupport for APIs, databases, and other tools.\nFunctionality: Facilitates the creation of intelligent assistants using large language models.\nUse Cases: Applicable in financial analysis and personalized assistance.\n\n\n\nAutoGen:\n\nIntroduction: A framework providing a no-code GUI for multi-agent application development.\nFeatures: Autonomous workflows with human-in-the-loop support.\nSupports agents using LLMs and tools.\nFunctionality: Facilitates the creation of complex, collaborative workflows in agentic systems.\nUse Cases: Used for multi-agent collaboration in research and development.\n\n\n\nCAMEL (Communicative Agents for Mind Exploration of Large Language Model Society):\n\nIntroduction: A library designed for studying autonomous and communicative agents through scalable techniques.\nFeatures: Facilitates role-playing to understand agent behaviors.\nProvides extensive documentation.\nFunctionality: Enables research into the behavior, capabilities, and potential risks of large language\nmodel-driven agents.\nUse Cases: Used in academic research and advanced AI exploration.\n\n\n\nOpenAI Swarm:\n\nIntroduction: A lightweight multi-agent orchestration framework released by OpenAI for experimental use.\nFeatures: Supports development of agentic systems that handle complex tasks.\nFacilitates collaborative task handling.\nFunctionality: Enables experimental projects in the field of agentic AI and multi-agent coordination.\nUse Cases: Used in academic research and advanced AI experimentation.\n\n\n\nVectara Agentic:\n\nIntroduction: A library enabling creation of specialized tasks-handling AI agents with financial inquiries or\nother specific domains.\nFeatures: Custom instructions for agent operation.\nTool integration support.\nFunctionality: Facilitates the development and deployment of custom-tailored agentic systems.\nUse Cases: Applicable in specialized sectors requiring targeted intelligent assistance.\n\n\n\nAdditional Context:\n\nDocumentation Quality: High-quality documentation is available for TensorFlow, LangChain, Phidata, AutoGen,\nCAMEL, and Vectara Agentic, with active communities providing support.\nCommunity Support: Each library benefits from a vibrant community of developers contributing to ongoing\nimprovements and innovative use cases.\nCommon Applications: Applications range from chatbot development and customer service to advanced AI research in\nmulti-agent collaboration.\n\n\nNot bad. I do not really think TensorFlow can be considered a library for implementing agentic AI.\nI guess maybe at a very low level, but what it is implementing is a way to interact with the model,\nnot really the creation of AI agents.\nI feel Qwen2.5:14b delivered the best output so far. It did not provide incorrect documentation links.\nThis opinion is unscientific, subjective, and based on a very small sample size. Take it with a\ngrain of salt.\nUsing mistral:7b\nI do not know much about Mistral, but let's give it a shot.\nUnfortunately it did not really work. It did not search the web, but just came up\nwith the information itself. It said the latest version of PyTorch was 1.11.0 released on\nDecember 14, 2021. Then its output caused the code to fail with an UnsupportedFormatException.\nEven its initial plan did not seem to make a ton of sense to me.\n\nStep 1 makes sense. Why does it want to inspect a file as text for each library found in step 2?\nWhen the search agent is called, it never ends up performing any searches. It just went immediately\nto provising a final answer.\nUsing gemma2:9b\nGemma's initial plan looks good. Then it chooses to limit its first search to the\nyear 2023. Not a good start. It then ends up having lots of issues generating proper\ncode. Maybe the context window is not big enough? I'm not really sure.\nUsing command-r7b:7b\nCommand-r7b's initial plan looks good. It just can't seem to generate the code to\nperform a web search.\nUsing granite3.1-dense:8b\nGranite3.1-dense's initial plan looks good too. Let's hope it can generate good\ncode and trigger the search agent. Woohoo, it did it! The search agent was called.\nIt only performs one web search. Then the search agent wants to return its result,\nbut there is a syntax error. 🤦‍♂️ Instead of fixing the syntax, its next response has\nthe same error. And again.\nI'm just going to give up on this one.\nUsing smollm2:1.7b\nI do not have a lot of hope for this one as it is so tiny. Let's see what happens.\nIts initial plan mentions using the inspect file as text tool. Just like Mistral.\nI wonder why two different models got tripped up the same way. Maybe the tool\ndescriptions could use some improvement?\nThen it generates code that will not parse. It just keeps not \"getting it\" and\njust returns this as its final answer:\n\nReformulated answer:  [1] agentic AI libraries, their key differences, and applications in AI development\n\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/foray-into-agentic-ai/","title":"Foray into Agentic AI"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/how-i-thought-i-had-invented-the-modular-monolith-video/":{"body":"The story of how I thought I had invented the Modular Monolith.\n\n    \n    \n\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/how-i-thought-i-had-invented-the-modular-monolith-video/","title":"How I thought I had invented Modular Monolith video"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/jpms-services-and-the-modular-monolith-video/":{"body":"Video that goes into how JPMS Services can supercharge a Modular Monolith application architecture.\n\n    \n    \n\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/jpms-services-and-the-modular-monolith-video/","title":"How JPMS Services can Supercharge Your Modular Monolith video"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/modular-monolith-youtube-video/":{"body":"I thought, at one point, that I had invented the concept of the modular monolith.

Ever since the first\ntime I saw a computer, I've been fascinated and obsessed. My curiosity is what\nultimately led to my career as a Software Engineer.\n\nIn elementary school, I was coding in Applesoft BASIC\non the classroom computers. Even this simple programming language allowed me to do all sorts\nof neat things. I drew on graph paper and then programmed the computer to display it by entering\nthe coordinates. I learned about conditional logic. It became apparent to me that there\nwas so much I could use it for.\nFast forwarding a ton, in my first job after college (that was not my own IT consulting firm), I was in\ncharge of running a computer lab for ESOL\nstudents at the local community college. There were so many repetitive tasks. I don't know\nabout you, but repetition to me is like a flashing red sign that says \"Don't waste, automate!\".\nI taught myself Python and automated away a lot of my work.\nFast forward a lot more. I'm in a role in the Citrix Education Department where I create\nlab manuals and virtualized environments that go with them. This is to support training\ncourses for candidates wanting to get Citrix Certified. The virtualized lab environments\nare real Windows virtual machines with Citrix products installed. They need to be set up\nsuch that the steps in the lab guides always work.\nI am creating the lab environments and manuals in lockstep and have a huge pain point.\nIt is hard to iterate when it takes a day for changes to my lab environment to be\ncaptured. I can't test my changes in the golden image because any changes I make will\nleave traces on the virtual machines. It also takes up to 8 hours for one of these lab\nenvironments to be provisioned and at least 30 minutes for one to be reset.\nWhat I need to be significantly more productive is a system that can quickly:\n\ncapture lab environments\ndeploy lab environments\n\nI whipped out my Python skills and created a novel proof of concept (PoC). My co-worker\nsaw the PoC and immediately knew it had great potential. He and I brainstormed and\ntogether we created a more polished PoC which we presented to upper management. They\nwere gobsmacked. How could two courseware developers have created a lab capture\nand provisioning system that rivals the third party one currently in use?\nMy co-worker and I continued to develop this new system in our spare time. The company\nthought \"there is no way these two guys can create a world-class lab delivery system\",\nbut they did see how much money could be saved by a system that could provision these\nlab environments so quickly. It would mean the training labs could be delivered on demand.\nThey would not need to schedule it all in advance which inevitably leaves costly resources idling. They\nissued an RFP to several large IT consultancies, including Infosys.\nWe participated in many meetings where these companies presented their proposals. Not\none of the proposals came close to the functionality and resilience our system provided.\nThe department decided to trial our system with some training that was being delivered in-house.\nIt worked great.\nWord of this new system spread throughout the company. The sales organization had training\nlabs at the company's two flagship conferences Citrix Synergy and Citrix Summit. The training\nlabs were self-service. Conference attendees could just walk up, sit at a computer, and choose\nfrom one of several training labs to complete. To support this, the team had to try to forecast\ndemand for each lab the night before. They would then provision the resources proportionally.\nThey also had to order a lot more resources than were ultimately needed because it took\nquite some time to reset.\nWe used the new provisioning system at the next event and they were hooked. We had slashed\nthe costs and were delivering a better end-user experience. Performance was much faster\nthan it had previously been and we no longer ran out of capacity for one or more of the\nlabs. With many more successful events under my co-worker and my belts, we were both\nmoved into the sales organization.\nMy new position was to work on the backend of the Citrix Demo Center.\nThis meant programming in Java. I had never touched any Java code at that point. I\nbuckled down and taught myself Java. Within two weeks I was already contributing code.\nIt wasn't great code, mind you, but I still think being able to pull that off is pretty\nimpressive. It was also fun. My co-worker was moved to an adjacent project.\nOver time I worked on lots more. Including new provisioning types on Google Cloud Platform,\nAmazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Citrix Cloud. Later on I designed a replacement\nfor the legacy system that managed all of this provisioning. I planned how we were going to\ntransition off of the old system without the users even noticing. I led the project, trained\na new engineer, and contributed lots of code myself. My co-worker from the education days\nwas pulled onto this project and, for a while, we got to re-live the amazing collaboration\nof our early years at Citrix.\nThe legacy system has since been retired. The new system has significantly less technical debt.\nI designed it defensively so that it should accrue this debt at a much slower rate. It is\nalso much easier to maintain because the design makes it nearly impossible for changes to\none type of provisioning form having any effect on the other types of provisioning. I call\nthe core idea behind the design a \"modular monolith\". It delivers the isolation microservices\nhave without the deployment complexity and many failure modes.\nThat is how I got to where I am now.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/my-self-taught-journey/","title":"My self-taught journey to becoming a Software Engineer"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/my-thoughts-on-coding-interviews/":{"body":"Let me start off by saying I am just plain bad at coding interviews. Some people\nare fast on their feet and others need more time to think. I need more time to think.\nCoding interviews are a way to eliminate lots of candidates when a ton have applied.\nThey are; however, in no way representative of actual day to day work.\nWhat is a coding interview\nIn case you have not participated in a coding interview, let me explain what\na coding interview is. Coding interviews are typically around 45 minutes long.\nThey are, most often, conducted over a video conference.\nThe first 15 minutes or so is usually an introduction and a chance to ask a few\nquestions. Then you usually need to open up a web-based coding tool. It is\nusually like a text editor, though some more advanced ones have syntax highlighting\nand allow for running the code.\nThe interviewer then pastes a coding riddle, asks you to read it, and then\nyou start. It is incumbent upon you to ask for clarification. You also\nneed to verbalize your though process. If you get particularly stuck,\nthe interviewer will often give you a clue or a nudge in the right direction.\nThey want you to do well too, as they have likely gone through this process themselves\nand know how tough it can be.\nOnce around 15 minutes have passed, the interviewer will stop you and paste another\ncoding riddle in. There are only 15 minutes left in the interview and the question\nmust be solved in that time. Once again, you need to confirm your understanding of\nthe problem with the interviewer and express your thought process out loud.\nThe idea behind the coding interview is to assess how you think and to\nquantify your coding proficiency.\nMy thoughts\nI do not feel the coding interview is an effective way to assess coding proficiency.\nThe process is so divorced from the day to day of a Software Engineer that the results\nare not representative. What do I mean?\nKinds of Problems\nSoftware Engineers have to solve new problems all the time. Problem solving is an\nextremely important skill to have. Most problems a Software Engineer will be faced\nwith on any given day will be related to the problem domains of the projects they are\nworking on. They are somewhat scope-limited.\nCoding interviews often present problems like implementing the\nBubble Sort algorithm. In real life\nyou will never need to do this. We use libraries to sort. The\nalgorithms are already implemented. It does not make sense to roll your own\nwhen there can be lots of performance tricks or edge cases to look out for.\nIt is simply good business sense to use a properly-vetted, popular library. If you\nare a bubble sort expert and can implement it from scratch, then I commend you.\nThat is pretty cool. If you have no clue how to do that, join the club.\nThen there are puzzles. The prompt will tell you about a desired behavior,\nand then give you example input and the desired output. There is nearly\nalways some kind of edge case to beware of and the example input will\nnot reveal it.\nHere is an example:\n\nThis is close to a real problem I was given. So what do we know?\n\nWe can only remove parenthesis.\nIf we go through the string from left to right, it should never have a closing parenthesis if we haven't yet seen an opening one.\nOpening and closing parenthesis need to stay in balance. As we go through the string we could possibly remove closing parenthesis when there are too many.\nWhen we get to the end of the string, there may be too many opening parenthesis. We may need to remove some, but we need to be careful how we do that.\n\nGreat. Now create the code to solve this problem. Don't take too long because there is another question\nto solve next.\nSome problems can be closer to the real-world, like one that might be related to scheduling such as:\n\nIt requires you to merge the tuples together and realize that (1,3), (5,9), (3,5), (7,8) will\nall merge to (1,9). Time is almost up, code something!\nEnvironment\nThe environment and circumstances coding interviews are performed under do not reflect\nday to day realities. These differences can have a large impact on performance.\nTools\nWhen you have been coding for  along time, you get used to the tools you regularly use.\nThese tools may, in effect, become a development crutch. That does not change that they\nare regularly used because they increase efficiency and help prevent errors. Ultimately,\nthe end goal is to create solid code that solves the problems at hand for your stakeholders.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) help perform code completion. If your IDE is\nautomatically filling in the name of a function you're trying to call, but now you are\nasked to code in a text editor, it stands to reason you may flub some of the names.\nIDEs also catch common mistakes. It makes the cost of making these kind of mistakes really low\nbecause it underlines the mistake, often offers to fix it for you, and does not allow you to\ncommit the mistake to your repository unless you ignore yet another warning. In a rushed coding\ninterview, it is easy to make simple mistakes. These mistakes may make it appear that you do not\nknow your stuff when you actually do.\nHere is an example of a mistake I made in a coding interview a few years ago.\n\nHere is the output:\n\nThat was a very embarrassing mistake and I am ashamed to even recount it here.\nThe mistake could easily lead to unexpected program behavior. It is a serious\nmistake. My IDE would have underlined apple1 == apple2 and pointed out the mistake.\nIf I did not see that, it would also have presented a warning I would need to read through\nbefore allowing a code commit.\nIn this case, my interviewer asked if I really know Java. That made me feel pretty\nlow. I made a mistake that would not have occurred had I not been coding under\nduress.\nI decided to use Python during coding interviews from then on. Java is a much\nmore verbose language. Even though I use Java for work, it always seemed like an\nonerous language without all the tooling to make it somewhat palatable. Python takes\nless time and fewer lines of code. This means there are less lines to mess up on.\nPure Python runs slower, but this is just for a coding interview. Python is\na language that is ergonomic to write in without tons of tooling. You will\nnot have great tooling during a coding interview.\nThoughts out loud\nInterviewers will try to gain insight into several aspects of your thought process.\nThey want to understand how you think and what your approach is to problem solving.\nThis might include trying to answer the following questions:\n\nDo you think logically?\nDo you try to understand the problem before jumping in and coding?\nDo you ask the interviewer about the problem rather than making assumptions?\nCan you anticipate edge cases in advance?\nHow do you work through getting stuck?\nAre you open to changing direction based on hints from the interviewer?\n\nThe goal to understand how you will approach and deal with problems makes sense.\nIn order to support that, you need to express your thoughts out loud. This\nfeels very unnatural to me. It leads me to lose my train of thought and I\nfind it incredibly distracting.\nMost Software Engineers I've met do not regularly express their thoughts as\nthey are writing code. They clarify requirements with stakeholders\nbefore beginning to code. When working on larger features, they usually first\ncome up with a plan for how they are planning to implement it to share with their\nteam and solicit feedback.\nThis kind of normal communication is very different.\n\nIt is usually at a higher level.\nThere is time to think about the problem first, truly understand it, and formulate ideas before\nhaving to communicate them. You do not have to \"think on your feet\" while the clock ticks down.\nNot all of the communication is spoken. It might be a combination of diagrams, prose,\nand meetings.\n\nBeing watched\nThe interviewer is watching you through your camera, listening to you through your microphone, and\nseeing your keystrokes. Knowing that someone is watching every moment feels strange. It makes the cost\nof making a mistake feel greater. I tend to self-censor.\nLet's say I'm on the right track. I keep trying to think ahead to make sure it is still a good solution\nbecause I do not want to make a mistake in front of the interviewer. Thinking ahead leads me to either lose\nmy train of thought or come up with a possible reason the current code I am working on is not correct.\nOftentimes that gets me right back at the starting point. I end up psyching myself out.\nThis may be performance anxiety.\nI'm not sure. It is not something that would happen if an interviewer were not there watching every moment.\nIf I was not being watched, I'd develop the way I normally do.\n\nGet a good sense of the problem to solve.\nSeek any clarification I might need.\nStart working on some code.\nCome up with various test cases to run through the code to catch mistakes and edge\ncases.\nExamine the code for simplicity. Can it be made simpler? Is someone else likely to\nunderstand the code at first glance?\nExamine the code for maintainability.\nIf a performance-sensitive part of a system, benchmark the code and try to optimize performance.\nMake sure all test cases still pass.\nPut in the code for a peer to code review. Then incorporate input.\n\nThere is not time to accomplish all of the above steps during a coding interview. The biggest\ndifference is starting to code earlier on and using test-driven development. The omnipresent\ninterviewer watching the process leads me to get stuck trying to come up with the entire approach\nto the problem first rather than just getting started and finding out problems experimentally.\nTime\n45 minutes. That is how much time you have to solve two coding riddles. In reality it is\ncloser to 30 minutes as the first 15 minutes are oftentimes the interviewer trying\nto get to know you a little. This leaves 15 minutes for each problem.\nThat is not much time. If you've seen a similar problem before and pretty much know its\nhidden pitfalls, you're golden. Maybe you've spent hours on LeetCode,\nHackerRank, or\nGeeksforGeeks solving\nquestions and happen to have seen something similar. If not, there is a good chance\nyou will get hung up on something. There is simply not enough time.\nAbility to research and consult with colleagues\nSoftware engineers have resources at their disposal. It is not a problem if you\ngo out onto the internet to research a problem. Your colleagues would also likely\nbe glad to answer a question here or there. When working, you do not have to have all\nthe knowledge in your head.\nDuring a coding interview you can not perform any research. These questions have\nall already been solved. You may happen upon the exact question and its answer.\nThat negates the whole purpose of the coding interview as you have now effectively used\nsomeone else's work.\nIn the real world we are always using someone else's work to a certain degree. There\nare many layers of the tech stack we are developing on top of. Someone else did\nthat work. The language we are coding in compiles down to machine code or bytecode.\nSomeone else did that work. The libraries included with the programming language as\nwell as additional libraries we use are all someone else's work.\nWe build our projects on top of the shoulders of giants. There is pure genius in the\nwork we are building on top of and incorporating into our projects. I would love to\nunderstand all of it. It is, frankly, not possible to know all of it. It would\ntake several lifetimes to truly explore it all. The best we can do is become\nexperts in our specific niches while staying curious and actively searching\nout opportunities to learn new things.\nThe blessing and curse of being self-taught\nOne of my superpowers is being able to learn quickly on my own. It has allowed me\nto be really successful. It stems from natural curiosity. This is a huge blessing.\nThe huge downside is that the coding interviews seem to often go back to\nComputer Science Fundamentals. These are the fundamental building blocks of\ncomputing taught in universities. I am not going to downplay CS fundamentals.\nQuite the contrary, they are what everything builds upon. In day to day\nwork you do need to be aware of them, but you do not need to be an expert\nbecause you have the tools in front of you to research any problem.\nI understand, for example, that using a map where you can look up a\nvalue by key is going to be significantly faster than iterating through\na list of values to find the one you're looking for. This concept is\njust intuitive to me. I've never designed my own map data structure though.\nThrough extensive experience, I've been able to build up a very good\nintuitive sense. It helps to guide my development. I often take a\n\"trust, but verify\"\napproach with my intuition. This can be in the form of benchmarking code or using\ntest-driven development\ntechniques. This helps to check my assumptions and further hone my intuition.\nNot going the traditional Computer Science route has not been a problem\nfor my career, but it is very much a problem when it comes to coding\ninterviews. They often are testing familiarity with Computer Science concepts\nrather than problem solving and coding ability. Many of the coding riddles seem\nto be designed around knowing one specific data structure or algorithm.\nIf you happen to know it you're golden. Otherwise you're out of luck.\nIt seems to me like the process is set up in a way that disadvantages\nself-taught professionals.\nMy advice\nIf you are currently going through coding interviews, hang in there. Take\ntime to study and practice possibly leveraging LeetCode,\nHackerRank, or\nGeeksforGeeks.\nHas this advice helped me so far? Not at all. But I will follow it and hang\nin there unless someone has a better idea.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/my-thoughts-on-coding-interviews/","title":"My thoughts on coding interviews"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/open-deep-research-using-langchain-working/":{"body":"I have Open Deep Research using LangChain working.

Now I am going to try to do the same using\nLangChain's Open Deep Research code.\nInitial Setup\nClone the repository locally and then cd into it.\n\nI am going to do the same as I have before by creating a Nix flake. See\nDiving Into AI for more information about Nix and\ninitially setting it up.\n\nThen git add flake.nix or else it will not work.\nAllow searching using DuckDuckGo\nThe code is setup by default to use the Tavily search API, and then Anthropic or OpenAI to\nrun the LLM. I want to change this to using DuckDuckGo for search and an LLM running locally.\nHere is what I did:\nIn src/open_deep_research/configuration.py, edit the SearchAPI class to:\n\nIn src/open_deep_research/utils.py:\n\nAdd the following import:\n\n\n\nCreate a duckduckgo_search function following the example of\nperplexity_search.\n\n\nIn src/open_deep_research/graph.py:\n\nOn line 14 add duckduckgo_search to the imports\nUpdate generate_report_plan so it can perform a DuckDuckGo search if configured to:\n\n\n\nUpdate search_web so it can perform a DuckDuckGo search if configured to\"\n\n\nAllow for using Ollama to run the LLM locally\nIn src/open_deep_research/configuration.py, edit PlannerProvider and WriterProvider to be able to use Ollama:\n\nLuckily, LangChain already supports Ollama. So this is the only change needed aside\nfrom installing langchain-ollama which flake.nix is already taking care of for us.\nRunning it\nI run nix develop and it pops up Jupyter in my browser. I navigate to /src/open_deep_research\nand create a new Jupyter notebook. I mostly copy from the graph.ipynb notebook.\n\nWhen I run it, I get the following error:\n\nI think this means the model is not generating the search queries properly when coming up\nwith a research plan.\nTroubleshooting the validation errors\nIf I change the code to operate at the message level and have it print each message,\nI should be able to get a better idea of what is happening:\n\nAmong the huge amount of output, I saw this:\n\nIt looks like it did, indeed, generate two queries and those are not in the format the validation\nerror is specifying. I revert the code changes. Right now, I'm not sure if it is the model that is\nsupposed to format them properly or some other code.\nLangChain appears to have really good documentation.\nI read How to return structured data from a model.\nFirst, the model must support .with_structured_output().\nIt looks like Ollama does support structured output.\nIt mentions installing langchain-ollama which I already did. It also mentions updating the ollama library\nto make sure the latest version supporting structured outputs is installed. That is worth trying.\nI open a terminal in Jupyter and type pip install -U ollama. Then I go back to my notebook\nand choose Restart Kernel and Run All Cells... from the Kernel menu. That does not help,\nbut it was worth a shot.\nThere really aren't any more clues in the LangChain Ollama documentation. I either need to debug\nthe code or create sample code. I am going to choose the latter.\nHere is my test code to see what is happening.\n\nI am getting similar errors with this code. That is very helpful because now I've pared this\ndown quite a bit.\nIf I change structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Queries) to structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Queries, include_raw=True),\nthen I can see the raw output. It looks like this:\n\nIn the tool_calls field, there is a Queries tool call with a list of search queries. The\nvalidation errors are saying\nInput should be a valid dictionary or instance of SearchQuery [type=model_type, input_value='report structure', input_type=str].\nIt is true the output is not a dictionary, but SearchQuery defines a single field that is a str.\nI suppose it wants the output to look like this?\n\nTime to learn more about pydantic. Yeah, that is the problem. Let's test my assumption above\nwhile taking LangChain completely out of the loop.\n\nThe output I get from running this is:\n\nThis confirms my suspicions. The model needs to be informed how to format the data. It\nseems like the tooling should do it automatically, but that does not appear to be happening.\nI find some details on how Ollama works with structured outputs.\nIt appears Ollama has a format parameter which accepts JSON. ChatOllama.with_structured_output accepts\na parameter called method. If we add method=\"json_schema\", maybe the call will work?\nTo test this theory, I go back to some earlier test code and modify the .with_structured_output\ncall.\n\nThis works! Now I go back to src/open_deep_research/graph.py and modify the code so that if planner_provider\nis ollama, then method=\"json_schema\" is included .with_structured_output call.\nI make the same change for writer_provider. I could just omit this conditional logic, but I want\nthis to still be compatible with other LLM providers.\n\nTime to test! I go back to my original Jupyter notebook, go to the Kernel menu\nand select Restart Kernel and Run all Cells. Now there is a RateLimit error\nwith the DuckDuckGo search API. I must've been sending out a ton of search queries\nto hit that.\nImplementing simple rate limiting for DuckDuckGo search\nThis is not going to be a production-grade fix here. I am simply going to make the\nduckduckgo_search wait 1 second between searches. If it hits a rate limit, it will\nwait 5 seconds and try the search that did not succeed again.\nI make the following changes to to src/open_deep_research/utils.py:\n\nImport the exception, and time:\n\n\n\nModify duckduckgo_search:\n\n\nThird time's the charm\nIt works... kind of. I think it has problems incorporating data from the search results when\nconstructing sections. I was watching outbound traffic and saw it connect to DuckDuckGo many times.\nWhat I did not see was it following any of the links.\nTo see updates after this post was written, please see\nOpen Deep Research Using LangChain Working.\nHere is what it generated.

You can now select the style of title to generate. This leaves room for a lot more creativity.\n\nThere did not appear to be a way for title styles to be dragged from Final Cut onto the extension.

I changed the default selected title style to one which shrinks the text. I did leave title styles which allow text to flow off the screen. Those can be manually edited to add line breaks. I may, in the future, add a capability to automatically create line breaks.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/titlebridge-1-1/","title":"TitleBridge 1.1 has a major new feature"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/titlebridge-my-first-app/":{"body":"TitleBridge converts captions in Final Cut into editable titles. It runs inside Final Cut\nand uses easy dragging and dropping. There's no longer any need to export captions, load them up into\nanother app, have the other app generate FCPXML with the titles, and then import the FCPXML\nback into Final Cut.\n\n    \n    \n\nBackstory\nIn the long, long ago I used to edit videos. It has been years since I last fired up Final Cut Pro. I've been experimenting with YouTube videos and wanted to make a video about how at one point I thought I had invented the modular monolith. I do not really like being on camera much and my setup here is not very good. My microphone; however, which I built from a kit, sounds really good to my ears. I decided to just record audio.\nSince I planned to distribute the video on YouTube, I needed some kind of visual. I'd seen lots of short-form videos with the captions burned in. That seemed like a good place to start. I had Final Cut automatically transcribe my audio to captions. It can export videos with the captions burned in; however, closed captions are very regulated so there is little flexibility on the look and positioning.\nI started researching. The best way to handle this, it seemed, was to create precisely timed titles with the words from the captions. I already had the precisely timed captions in Final Cut. It would be a waste of time to manually create a title for each caption and then snap the start and end to the caption. This problem was ripe for automation and others surely had workflows to handle this.\nThe best I could find were either:\n\nWebsites that convert captions files into titles and then export FCPXML for import into Final Cut\nApplications that mostly require monthly subscriptions\n\nThe subscriptions are usually because the apps are using AI to generate the captions. Final Cut now can automatically transcribe your audio to captions as long as you are running on Apple Silicon. I did not need third party transcription and I am pretty sick of how everything is becoming a subscription.\nRegardless, all options I could find had a workflow that involves leaving Final Cut. Most need you to:\n\nExport the captions from Final Cut\nImport the captions\nExport FCPXML\nImport the FCPXML into Final Cut\n\nI thought it would be so much simpler to never leave Final Cut and do everything with drag and drop. It would be extremely cool if you could just drop the titles directly onto the project timeline rather than having them show up somewhere in a new project in the media library. Since no one else did it, I figured I might as well do it.\nRight now the application is being reviewed by Apple for inclusion in the App Store. I'll charge a little bit for it, but it will be a one-time fee. If I add new features, I'm planning on just releasing them to those who already purchased it. I wonder if there is a market for this little app...\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/titlebridge-my-first-app/","title":"TitleBridge is my first app"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/vibe-coding/":{"body":"I have repeatedly heard the term Vibe Coding since last month. Having worked in Software Engineering for over 13 years, I naturally have a bit of skepticism. Determined not to fall into the curmudgeon trap, I am going to try out vibe coding and see what it is all about.\nTools\nTo make this work, I am going to need to use tools that are made for vibe coding. There are a bunch to choose from, and I am not an expert... yet.\nMy IDE of choice for personal projects is currently Zed. It is not really set up for vibe coding. There is a way to enable some aspects of it by adding \"enable_experimental_live_diffs\": true to the assistant section in settings.json, but I want to give this a fair shake.\nThere are two main Vibe Coding tools that caught my eye:\n\nCursor\nCline\n\nCursor is a complete IDE in and of itself. It looks like it is effectively tied to a subscription after a two week free trial. Cline is an Open Source plugin for VSCode.\nI feel like Cursor will be more likely to just work. Since I'm trying to give this a fair shake  I will use Cursor. I am more inclined to like the idea of Cline better due to its open source nature. It also looks like with Cline you pay the AI providers directly rather than going through a middleman. If I like Vibe Coding in Cursor, I will try Cline.\nWhat to create and the prompt I am going to use\nSince I am currently looking for a new job, I think a Job Application tracking tool would be helpful. It would be nice as a GUI application for now. I want it created in Rust. I know Rust is not the ideal programming language for GUI development at this point, but there are several UI libraries. I'm sure this would work better in Python or JavaScript as a website.\nBare minimum functionality\nHere is my prompt for the minimum functionality.\n\nNice to have functionality\nIf this works, it would be nice to have the application go out to the Job description URL and automatically fill in the title field.\nCursor\nI install Cursor and create a blank directory for the project. Then I open Cursor to that directory and am ready to begin.\nI paste in the prompt for the bare minimum application. This is really cool. It has created a main.rs file with the code and a cargo.toml file with the dependencies. I just click on the Apply all button and those files are created like magic.\nNow I ask the AI to run the application. It gives me a bunch of steps I don't need to do. I was hoping it would run the application so it could see any errors and automatically correct them. Let me try again generate a command to run this application (it should just create cargo run). This is also completely unhelpful. It creates some crazy commands that will echo the contents of the various files onto the machine. The last command; however, is cargo run and there is a little button that says Run. Click.\nIt just ran it in the terminal. I could have done that. The application will not compile. There is a button in the chat panel called Add context. When I click on that, it lets me add context from the terminal. Now I tell the AI that the application will not compile.\nIt claims to have figured out the problem. I click the Apply all and then Accept all buttons without really paying attention. That is what Vibe Coding is all about, right?\nRunning it again in the terminal. Will it compile? Nope. Now I am going to repeat the last step by adding the terminal context in again. Told it to apply the changes it made. Will it work now?\nNope. There are still syntax errors. Let me see if I can get the AI to try to compile and then see the errors automatically. If it can loop through this, that would make iteration faster.\n\nThe application will not compile. Can you please compile the application and then fix any errors you find until the application compiles properly?\n\nIt decided to create a fresh project!? Then says it will then iteratively compile and fix things. It did not actually try to compile and fix things. I have seen demos on YouTube where it did this, so I know it is possible...\nI updated the context to have the whole codebase. Then I prompted it:\n\nPlease compile and test this code.\n\nIt made a bunch of changes again which I applied. Then it ended with the cargo run command. So I clicked Run. Alas, it ran it in the terminal and still will not compile. I can't say I am terribly impressed.\nIt looks like it was in Ask mode. Let me try Agent mode. I think that will allow for the AI to \"take charge\" a little more. Now it is doing what I expected. It is building and fixing. This is nice.\nIt did two rounds of compile and fix and now the application came up. It allows for tabbing through the fields. It saves the applications and lets you get back to them to edit. The only thing that is not working is the calendar date picker.\n\nThe application compiled and came up, but the datepicker is not displaying properly for the two date fields. On Date Submitted it does not show at all. On Response Date it shows what appears to be multiple instances of the widget.\n\nIt purports to fix it, but the same exact behavior occurs I run it.\n\nThe datepicker issue is not fixed.\n\nThen it does not compile, so the AI agent immediately goes about trying to fix it. The application then compiles, but now neither date picker will work.\n\nNow the date picker does not work for either date field.\n\nIt fixes it so something pops up, but it is not really the whole date picker.\n\nIt now pops up something when I click on the button, but it is not a whole date picker. I have attached a screenshot.\n\nIt then fails to compile, so the AI immediately goes about trying to fix it. Now something pops up with the current year, month, and day as well as a button that says Today, but it does not allow actually picking a date.\n\nThe date picker pops up and has the current day, month, and year. It also has a today button. It is missing the days in the month to select from.\n\nI send the prompt above with a screenshot. This is starting to feel more tedious than just trying to do it myself. It now lets me choose any day from this month, but the arrows next to the month to change it just cause the date picker to go away.\n\nThe date picker now allows for choosing any day this month. It does not allow changing the month. The arrows next to the month only cause the date picker to disappear.\n\nIt makes some ineffective changes.\n\nThe same problem is occurring with the date picker.\n\nIt makes some changes and now it will not compile. It then goes ahead and makes some additional changes. It still does not compile, so it makes additional changes. Now it compiles. The arrow buttons next to the month do not cause the date picker to disappear, but they also do not do anything.\n\nThe arrows near the month no longer cause the date picker to go away when clicked. These buttons are supposed to change the month. The one on the left of the month should change it to the month that comes before the currently displayed month. The button after the month should change it to the month that comes after the currently displayed month.\n\nIt makes some changes, but the same problem is occurring.\n\nThe previous problem is still occurring.\n\nNow it goes to change the popup behavior, but that is not the problem. It looks like it is trying to put back the old broken code where the widget kept disappearing. I reject the changes.\n\nThe popup behavior is not the problem. The issue is that the month in the date picker can not be changed.\n\nIt still does not work. I am going to stop working on it at this point.\nHere is the cargo.toml it generated:\n\nThere is a newer Rust edition that should be used on a new project: 2024.\nThe latest eframe, egui, and egui_extras version is 0.31.1. We are starting a project out with a dependency version that is over a year out of date.\nHere is the main.rs it generated:\n\nI do not have any experience with the egui framework, but this code seems somewhat complex for what it is. Especially around the date picker. Egui already has a built-in date picker with the desired behaviors built in. All you need to do is use the following code (from the documentation):\n\nConclusion\nMy sample size is incredibly small and I did dictate the programming language used. It is also not a web app, which I suspect most projects Vibe Coding is used for are. Please take this conclusion with a grain of salt.\nVibe Coding, from what I can see, is a way of making something quickly. What you end up with might be convoluted code using libraries that are a year out of date. If you don't look at the code, it might appear you have made something good.\nIt reduces the friction to get started on something. If what you created is a success, you're going to have to maintain what the AI created for you. Developers spend more time reading code than writing it. It means the time saved upfront might lead to a lot more time down the road. Unless, of course, the AI can maintain the code as well (which is not out of the realm of possibility).\nThe experience I had here was not enjoyable. I was not \"vibing\". It felt like it would have been easier to just do it myself. I do not particularly like the code it generated. I still have no idea how to use the egui library, nor do I even know if it is the best gui library for the job.\nI love learning. Using an AI assistant while coding helps me learn and can save time. Especially when I turn off the distracting autocomplete suggestions from it and just chat in a sidebar. I use the AI more like a research assistant who has read the manual.\nVibe coding feels more like throwing darts at a dartboard with a blindfold on. I get to take the blindfold off after each throw to see where I ended up, but then I need to take another shot in the dark.\nI could have probably gotten a better result with improved prompts or letting the AI make different choices about the language to use. Frankly, though, if we all adapt to what the AI is trained the best to do it is like reversion to the mean. Lots of AI written software will likely all be using the same language, out of date libraries, and have the same security vulnerabilities.\nVibe coding, in its current form, is not for me. I am not a vibejockey producing vibejacked code.\nThanks qwq model running locally for vibejockey and vibejacked.\n\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/vibe-coding/","title":"Vibe Coding"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-a-lead/":{"body":"The other day I was on Lemmy and someone asked in lemmy.world/c/programminghumor what being a Senior Software Engineer entails. Theirs was a comment below a meme of a senior dev gracefully and confidently diving into a firepit with spikes labeled \"legacy code\". This is how I responded.\n\nI’ve been a lead dev/architect for a while. I am not better at coding than my co-workers who are junior to me. In many ways they are better than me in that they come in with a fresh perspective, new ideas, and lots of enthusiasm.\nIn my mind, the main differences between the roles come down to soft skills, getting comfortable with and staying calm with uncertainty/gray areas, and being good at asking for feedback and listening. These are all things you just end up learning.\nHere are some of the things I’ve had to do a lot more of as I got into a more senior position:\n\n\nGetting a “feeling” for how technical decisions will weather over time given past experience.\n\n\nBeing able to effectively listen to stakeholders and really understand their needs. Asking good follow-up questions and communicating my understanding in non-technical terms they can identify with. This often involves coming up with differing scenarios and seeing if the behavior the system would have is what they really want.\n\n\nGetting comfortable working in grey areas.\n\n\nSeeking feedback and ideas from the engineering team and stakeholders. Iterating on a design and incorporating the feedback.\n\n\nTrying to tease out the best direction for the architecture that will be most likely to meet current and future needs, stand the test of time, and be less likely to accrue too much technical debt.\n\n\nStaying calm when external circumstances change in unpredictable ways. Planning how to adapt to the changes in the most effective way. Determining whether future changes in a certain area are likely to occur given company direction. Guiding the architecture to more easily be able to accommodate those kind of changes in the future, if they seem likely.\n\n\nBeing a mentor for the engineers. Trying to always make myself available to help. Being willing to dig into the weeds to figure things out. Feeling invested in their success.\n\n\nCoding. I still code a lot as well. I think this is important. First off, I like coding and making things. Architecture designs are great, but they’re just an idea, not something that can readily be used. Additionally, architectural decisions that don’t take into account the actual experience of coding them are not likely to lead to good outcomes. Sometimes, I can come up with something that sounds great. Then, when I try to scaffold it, it turns out there is a better way that will be much more pleasant for all involved.\n\n\nBeing humble. I don’t know everything. I’m not always right. We are successful as a team when everyone is involved and listened to.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-a-lead/","title":"My experience being a lead"},"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-agentic-ai-written-by-agentic-ai/":{"body":"The following post is written by Open Deep Research using Qwen2.5:14b.\nThe prompt was:\n\nWrite an article on agentic AI. The audience is Software Engineers who do not have a\nlot of experience with AI. Please cover, among other things: what agentic AI is, the best\nuse cases for agentic ai, pros and cons of using agentic ai, where agentic ai may be going\nin the future. Feel free to cover other aspects of agentic ai as well.\n\n\n\nAgentic AI refers to advanced forms of artificial intelligence capable of making autonomous decisions, taking actions based on its understanding of the environment and predefined objectives, without direct human oversight. This technology leverages sophisticated algorithms such as reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to navigate complex scenarios dynamically.\nKey Concepts for Non-Experts:\n\nPlanning: Agentic AI breaks down a goal into manageable steps or plans, which it then executes efficiently.\nReasoning: The system uses logical reasoning to understand its environment, make decisions based on available information, and predict outcomes of actions.\nDecision-Making: This involves choosing the best course of action from multiple options to achieve its objectives effectively.\n\nReal-World Applications:\nExamples include self-driving vehicles (such as those developed by Tesla or Waymo), customer support chatbots that autonomously handle inquiries, diagnose issues, and provide solutions (like Microsoft's AI-driven customer service bots), and supply chain optimization systems used by companies like FedEx to manage inventory levels and route logistics dynamically.\nPros of Agentic AI:\n\nEnhanced Efficiency: Automated complex tasks lead to faster execution and reduced errors.\nCost Reduction: Minimizing the need for constant human oversight lowers operational costs significantly.\nImproved Productivity: Agentic AI can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, increasing overall productivity.\n\nCons of Agentic AI:\n\nEthical Concerns: Ensuring agentic systems operate ethically and responsibly without direct human control is critical.\nSecurity Risks: As these systems become more autonomous, the risk of security breaches increases substantially.\nRegulatory Hurdles: Implementing regulations to govern agentic AI's actions and ensure public safety remains a challenge.\n\nFuture Direction:\nUnderstanding Agentic AI requires familiarity with its underlying principles and practical applications. For non-experts, it’s essential to grasp how these systems operate independently but are designed to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. The technology promises significant advancements in various industries, yet addressing ethical concerns, security risks, and regulatory issues is crucial for successful implementation\n","id":"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-agentic-ai-written-by-agentic-ai/","title":"What is Agentic AI - Written by Agentic AI"}},"docInfo":{"https://bustin.tech/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bustin.tech/apps/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://bustin.tech/apps/titlebridge/":{"body":111,"title":1},"https://bustin.tech/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bustin.tech/posts/coding-interview-fail-video/":{"body":5,"title":4},"https://bustin.tech/posts/creating-a-gui-application-in-rust-using-dioxus/":{"body":923,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/creating-horse-hot-or-not/":{"body":653,"title":3},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-1/":{"body":798,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-2/":{"body":809,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/daily-coding-problem-problem-3/":{"body":953,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/diving-into-ai/":{"body":617,"title":2},"https://bustin.tech/posts/farm-life-rendering-beeswax/":{"body":511,"title":4},"https://bustin.tech/posts/foray-into-agentic-ai/":{"body":2936,"title":3},"https://bustin.tech/posts/how-i-thought-i-had-invented-the-modular-monolith-video/":{"body":5,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/jpms-services-and-the-modular-monolith-video/":{"body":9,"title":6},"https://bustin.tech/posts/modular-monolith-youtube-video/":{"body":19,"title":4},"https://bustin.tech/posts/my-self-taught-journey/":{"body":531,"title":6},"https://bustin.tech/posts/my-thoughts-on-coding-interviews/":{"body":1243,"title":3},"https://bustin.tech/posts/open-deep-research-using-langchain-working/":{"body":1402,"title":6},"https://bustin.tech/posts/open-deep-research-using-langchain/":{"body":983,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/titlebridge-1-1/":{"body":106,"title":5},"https://bustin.tech/posts/titlebridge-my-first-app/":{"body":274,"title":3},"https://bustin.tech/posts/vibe-coding/":{"body":931,"title":2},"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-a-lead/":{"body":259,"title":3},"https://bustin.tech/posts/what-is-agentic-ai-written-by-agentic-ai/":{"body":280,"title":5}},"length":25},"lang":"English"}
