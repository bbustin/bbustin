The following post is written by Open Deep Research using Qwen2.5:14b.
The prompt was:

> Write an article on agentic AI. The audience is Software Engineers who do not have a
lot of experience with AI. Please cover, among other things: what agentic AI is, the best
use cases for agentic ai, pros and cons of using agentic ai, where agentic ai may be going
in the future. Feel free to cover other aspects of agentic ai as well.

Agentic AI refers to advanced forms of artificial intelligence capable of making autonomous decisions, taking actions based on its understanding of the environment and predefined objectives, without direct human oversight. This technology leverages sophisticated algorithms such as reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to navigate complex scenarios dynamically.

**Key Concepts for Non-Experts:**
1. **Planning:** Agentic AI breaks down a goal into manageable steps or plans, which it then executes efficiently.
2. **Reasoning:** The system uses logical reasoning to understand its environment, make decisions based on available information, and predict outcomes of actions.
3. **Decision-Making:** This involves choosing the best course of action from multiple options to achieve its objectives effectively.

**Real-World Applications:**
Examples include self-driving vehicles (such as those developed by Tesla or Waymo), customer support chatbots that autonomously handle inquiries, diagnose issues, and provide solutions (like Microsoft's AI-driven customer service bots), and supply chain optimization systems used by companies like FedEx to manage inventory levels and route logistics dynamically.

**Pros of Agentic AI:**
1. **Enhanced Efficiency:** Automated complex tasks lead to faster execution and reduced errors.
2. **Cost Reduction:** Minimizing the need for constant human oversight lowers operational costs significantly.
3. **Improved Productivity:** Agentic AI can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, increasing overall productivity.

**Cons of Agentic AI:**
1. **Ethical Concerns:** Ensuring agentic systems operate ethically and responsibly without direct human control is critical.
2. **Security Risks:** As these systems become more autonomous, the risk of security breaches increases substantially.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles:** Implementing regulations to govern agentic AI's actions and ensure public safety remains a challenge.

**Future Direction:**
Understanding Agentic AI requires familiarity with its underlying principles and practical applications. For non-experts, itâ€™s essential to grasp how these systems operate independently but are designed to enhance human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. The technology promises significant advancements in various industries, yet addressing ethical concerns, security risks, and regulatory issues is crucial for successful implementation
