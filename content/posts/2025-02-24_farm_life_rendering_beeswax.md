My wife, the animal lover, got us into beekeeping several years ago. I had no idea how
much I would like bees then. This weekend, after processing honey, I decided I wanted
to render and filter the remaining wax. This is the first time I have ever done anything
like this.

# Research
## Initial Questions
My first step is always a little bit of research.

* What is the process?
* What temperature does beeswax melt at?
* What are some products one can make out of beeswax?
* Is there anything to watch out for or be careful about?

### What is the process?

What I could see from my research is that all of the techniques involve melting the wax first. Then there are one or more filtering steps. Finally, the purified wax is filled into a form or used to create a product.

Different sites had slightly different variations. The main differences I could see were:

* Where the initial melting step should be performed.
* What kind of filtering medium to use.

The initial melting step could be performed directly in a double boiler. Then the melted wax is poured over some kind of filter and the filtered wax drips through into another container. If the wax does not come out clean enough, then the step can be repeated.

The other option is to surround the wax in some sort of water-resistant filter medium. Then dunk it in a pot of water that is at the correct temperature. The wax then filters through as it melts. Once all of the wax is melted, tongs can be used to squeeze the last of the wax through the filter medium into the pot. The pot is then allowed to cool. Since wax is lighter than water, a disk of wax forms on the surface of the water.

To filter the wax, I saw a variety of different materials being used including:

* cheese cloth
* muslin
* old t-shirts
* paper towels

### What temperature does beeswax melt at?

Beeswax melts at around 145¬∫ F or 63¬∫ C. It has a relatively high melting point for a wax. This gives it some serious staying power. It also makes it really difficult to clean up.

### What are some products one can make out of beeswax?

It seems like the products fall into some broad categories:

* candles
* cosmetics
* polish (wood polish, clothes waterproofing, rust prevention)
* lubrication (wood drawer slides, sewing thread)
* crayons
* food preservation (used as a food safe coating)

The cosmetics and the polish are essentially made the same way. Mix the beeswax with oil in a certain ratio. Then heat it up gently, mix it well, and pour it into its final container or mold.

### Is there anything to watch out for or be careful about?

The two main things to watch out for are:

1. Make sure not to get hot wax on you. It will solidify on your skin and may burn you.
2. The internet says if beeswax is heated too long or too hot, its color will change from a yellow to more of a brown.

# Extracting and Purifying the Beeswax

Since this is my first time doing this, I want to make it as easy as possible. So I use the following questions to guide my decisions:

* What can I do to make the least mess possible?
* How can I use the smallest amount of kitchenware?
* Is there a way to eliminate some of the steps?

The wax is already in a cheesecloth-like fabric. We used that to extract the honey since we do not have one of those centrifugal honey extracting machines. I put the fabric-encased wax into a pot and slowly bring the water up to temperature. I do not have a candy thermometer as one of the articles suggested, so I just use a meat thermometer.

It takes a while for the wax to start melting, but indeed it does. When I think that all the wax is melted, I pick up the cheesecloth bag, and use tongs to carefully squeeze out the rest of the wax. Then I let the pot cool and the wax hardens on the surface of the water creating a disk. This makes minimal mess in the pot. Just a little ring around the top.

There are some impurities in the wax disk. I think my filtering medium was not fine enough.  If I were to do it again, I would put it in double cheese cloth. This way, I could avoid an additional filtering step. The other thing I would've done is not worried as much about the temperature. It took a really long time to melt. I was likely overly cautious.

Since there are some impurities, I decide to perform an additional filtering step. So much for not using a lot of kitchenware! Unfortunately, I have run out of cheese cloth. The other thing my research calls for is a double boiler. I also do not have one of those. Not a problem. I put the wax in a mason jar, boil water in a pot, and put the mason jar in the pot. The wax melts and I can see all the impurities floating about.

I decide to use paper towels instead of cheese cloth to filter the wax. I put paper towels over another glass container and then pour the melted wax in. It slowly drains through. The filtered liquid looks great! I pour some of the wax into a soap form. The rest I use in a ratio of three parts olive oil to one part beeswax to create a salve.

This was all a lot easier than I expected. There is definitely a lot of gatekeeping on the Internet. While it may be true that there are ways to do it better, I think you can get 90% of the way there without specialized tools or great technique.

How is the salve? It is a little hard and kind of greasy, but it has staying power. I like it so far. It is kind of the same as a wood polish. I‚Äôm not sure olive oil is a great oil to use in wood polish though as it could go rancid. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
