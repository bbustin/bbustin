I wanted to familiarize myself with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), so I made a short YouTube video.
It is not my finest work, but you need to start somewhere, right? I also got to get back into Final Cut Pro

The video goes into what I was trying to do with OBS and then some of the various things I have been working
on lately. That basically just ends up being an overview of this blog.
