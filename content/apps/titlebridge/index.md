Convert captions to editable titles without leaving Final Cut

<!--more-->

TitleBridge is a Final Cut Pro workflow to make adding captions as titles easy. There is no need to leave Final Cut
to add editable titles from your captions and no need to subscribe to any services.

# System Requirements

* Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or better processor)*
* Final Cut Pro 11.1+

\* TitleBridge does not require Apple Silicon. We recommend this so Final Cut is able to
transcribe your audio to captions. Without this functionality, you will either need to
manually enter your captions or use a third-party tool. It is much more pleasant and efficient
to be able to do it all from within Final Cut.
