# System Requirements

* Mac with Apple Silicon (M1 or better processor)*
* Final Cut Pro 11.1+

\* TitleBridge does not require Apple Silicon. We recommend this so Final Cut is able to
transcribe your audio to captions. Without this functionality, you will either need to
manually enter your captions or use a third-party tool. It is much more pleasant and efficient
to be able to do it all from within Final Cut.
